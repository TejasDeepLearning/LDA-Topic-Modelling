"Kellie of Salt Lake City, UT","Nov. 9, 2016",1,"I Have been a long time customer and only have Xfinity as my ISP for a while now. While I was in the local Walmart on November 4, 2016, there were customer representatives from Xfinity running promotions for and in the Salt Lake City area. Spoke with a representative and was able to get and signed a contract for Pro Blast at $50.00 a month with no contract or early termination fees. I received an email from Xfinity stating the changes that would be made to my account. It stated that not only would it be under contract for 24 months but there would be early termination fees. This is not what I had originally signed up for and it specifically states this on the contract that I signed. Contacted Xfinity customer service and was told since they cannot see the contract over the phone that I would need to go to Xfinity store in person. Went to Xfinity store on November 8, 2016 and was told that it would be under contract and there was no way around it. Because of this I have cancelled the upgrade and went back to my original plan. It's plain and simple. When a contract is signed it should be honored for what is stated on it. Xfinity is dishonest and not trustworthy. Therefore I will be looking and changing my ISP as soon as possible to another company. Xfinity does not deserve a paycheck from me or anyone else that I know."
"Liz of Eden Prairie, MN","Oct. 31, 2016",1,"Unplanned, unexpected, all day outages, rude service reps. Rearranging my day to set up service only to deal with a totally inept technician who has to call for backup on another day. I could go on, but why? We are dropping this failure of a company and relying on hotspots from now on."
"sandra of Houston, TX","Oct. 17, 2016",1,I set up an appointment and it was inconvenient to make sure I was home. After 30 mins past the window I phoned and spoke to a foreign agent who assured me I would get a call back within 30 mins. An hour later after being given a ticket number no one has bothered to call me. My internet service is so terrible and slow and nonexistent.
"Paige of Birchrunville, PA","Sept. 10, 2016",1,"Just over an hour with 3 different departments and supervisors and multiple holds on a Saturday to find out the movie I BOUGHT on Pay per view is malfunctioning. Have been with comcast for years, spent thousands of dollars and just didn't want to focus on changing services. I have multiple services to choose from and will be spending the time to change after this fiasco. There are so many complaints about Comcast it doesn't seem worthwhile to go into the details here as nothing ever improves so I am out."
"F. D. of Chattanooga, TN","Aug. 31, 2016",1,"Well, I moved to Chattanooga from Atlanta for a new career venture. I haven't purchased cable for at least 4 yrs now because I stream everything and I firmly believe cable tv is a waste of money that will soon be obsolete. Back to topic, I opted for Xfinity/Comcast over Chattanoogas EPB mostly because it was familiar and cheaper. I got a pretty decent deal coming from a previously handsome employee management discount with ATT. Although UVerse was even worse than Xfinity/Comcast, I put up with it because it was so cheap. So, Comcast. Good deal. Great internet speed. No contract.The first issue arose after a month and a half in. I kept getting a notification that I was about to reach my data limit and would be charged $10 per gig if I went over. I was never informed of data caps when I purchased. If so, I would have opted for EPB because they have none and I stream a lot. I can't have a data cap of 600gigs a month. So I called to complain and cancel. I had already contacted EPB and set up an install date. I'm not sure why but I called Comcast again to inquire more about the data cap and to tell them that I wasn't paying for overages. I was then informed that Comcast had decided to raise the data caps to 1050gigs. I was assured that I would never reach it so I decided to stay with Comcast.Now that that was resolved it was back to my regular schedule until I noticed that my internet speeds were gradually getting slower. Then over the past 3 weeks, the internet connection started dropping. I called and was told it was my router. That it was damaged and needed to be exchanged for a new one. I never got around to getting a new router but it kept dropping at the same time every day between 7 pm & 9 pm. So I contacted them again and the Rep fixed the issue and told me that the problem wasn't my router but the way it was wired.So after rewiring it was working fine but now it's not only getting slower every day but the connection drops frequently. Still between certain hours but always after 6 pm. It's so bad now that it's dropping the connection at least every 30 to 45 mins. That's just this evening and even now at 12:55 am EST. I have two choices... Wait between 7-10 mins for the router to reboot and reconnect on its own once the connection returns or I manually unplug and force a reboot which takes a while as well and still does not guarantee a connect even after all the lights are solid and flashing.Now I have the Xfinity My Account app which NEVER says there is a reported outage but instead just informs me that my router is not connected to the internet. I can also restart via the app but it's useless too. I've finally had enough. I'm leaving Comcast behind. It's become a complete hassle. I'm paying for services that I can only enjoy up until 6 pm daily. I'm at my wits end. Comcast is officially the worst internet service in the nation. I mean Uverse is extremely slow but I could at least depend on that slow connection. It rarely went down... Even in storms but with Comcast I can't even keep a connection. If you have Comcast do yourself a favor and rid yourself of it."
"Hannah of Chicago, IL","Aug. 5, 2016",1,"I have always hated Comcast, but have used their services for years just because they are the most common service provider. I recently moved and tried to set up Internet through them at my new apartment. The confirmation email I received after ordering the service was completely wrong. They had my wrong address and did not even give me an account number for my new service. I contacted a rep online to get it sorted out. He was so unknowledgeable and unhelpful, I told him I just wanted to cancel the service altogether. He assured me my card would not be charged for the service because he cancelled it. I told him ""ok so when my card IS charged for it anyway, can I get a reference # for this chat for my personal records?"" He blatantly refused to give it to me. I had to ask to speak to a supervisor who finally gave me the code and also 100% assured me my card would not be charged.This morning I checked my bank account and was not at all surprised to find a withdrawal from Comcast. I immediately called and the rep I spoke to wasted almost 2 hours of my time just to tell me she can't find any account charge so she can't do anything about it. I again had to ask for a manager, who instantly said he found the charge and would refund it. I now have to wait 5-7 business days for a refund check for a charge I was repeatedly promised would not be made. The worst customer service in the nation. Will never be a Comcast customer again. I am willing to pay MORE money at this point for literally any other provider."
"John of Miami, FL","July 29, 2016",1,"2 - 3 weeks ago I started having problems with my internet. Sometimes it would work perfect and I would get 70MB+ download speed, other times it would drop to ~2MB… I work from home and I am constantly using Skype to stay in touch with co-workers and clients, you can do this with 2MB d/l. I immediately followed the normal, try to unplug the wireless modem and plug it back in, no change. I called in and used their automated system to reset the modem, no change. I had a modem that was not being rented from Comcast so they were reluctant to send a service tech out to help and pretty much just blamed the problem on the modem. I called the modem provider followed their troubleshooting, no change.. they assured me the problem was with Comcast…Here comes the fun part. I decide to get a modem from Comcast so I can get a tech out to resolve the problem. I have three options: 1. Get it shipped for $10, 2. Have it delivered and installed by a tech for $50, 3. Pick it up myself for free. Being the kind of person that likes to save money, I go with option 3. The woman at Comcast I spoke to told me I could go to their Leominster MA location (I live in NH). When I get to the Comcast service center I am told that their modems are for MA residents only…. Great. First Big issues.Finally, I get a Comcast modem back to my house, get it all set up and turn on my wi-fi devices. Not only do I experience the same problem, but now it is much, much worse. I reconnect my personal modem and call to have a tech come out to resolve the problem, this was on a Friday. They explained a tech would be out Monday to fix the problem, but the fun part is they could not give me ANY time frame, just “sometime Monday” and they will call before they show up.Monday comes around it's noon and still no word. I get on Comcast chat support and they assure me someone will be here as scheduled… 4 o’clock comes around, I get on Comcast chat, they assure me someone will be here as scheduled. No one ever showed. Now I’m mad. First thing Tuesday morning I give Comcast a call. They never rescheduled an appointment after the one missed Monday, and they refuse to set me up a same day appointment. The only time he could offer me was Wednesday between 9am-12am (at least it’s not a 24 hour window). He scheduled it and I told him I needed to talk to his manager, he understood and told me I would receive a call from his manager with 1-2 hours. The manager never called.On Wednesday morning I receive a voicemail from Comcast confirming my appointment for between 6pm – 7pm… What the actual **. 5:25pm comes around and the tech pulls up in front of my house, sits in his van for 35 minutes until 6pm (my two big dogs were not pleased). He comes in my house for about 10-15 minutes plugs his stuff into my modem, checked to make sure the wire wasn’t loose and says it seems normal, and that they will be back the next day (Thursday) to replace the line from the telephone pole to my house. The guy literally did nothing else.All day Thursday no one came… surprise, surprise. Here we are today on Friday I get in touch with a person from Comcast, nothing was scheduled for anyone to come out to my location and resolve my issue. They tell me that I should expect a call from a tech to schedule another appointment. I won't hold my breath. Comcast has left a permanent bad taste in my mouth. This is literally the worst customer service I have EVER received. It is amazing your company is still in business."
"Ross of Belmont, MI","July 24, 2016",1,Comcast notified that they are going to start charging for a cable modem that I own. They are now trying to claim that they own it. They have done this to me off and on for the last 4 years. They make me fight and waste my time. I ask for a credit for the problems and they won't give me anything for the time I waste. How do you fight a company this big that does not care about their customers? I have heard this is a common problem with Comcast to scam their customers.
"Chris of Scranton, PA","June 30, 2016",1,"I don't even know where to start. Well I got Comcast internet hooked up in 2012 and besides little issues I never had a problem UNTIL March of 2015! I have had about 30 modem/routers hooked up in my home always the same continuous problem. Speeds are fine, 0 packet loss, but the one major problem is my ping times are reaching 200-300 ms at random times. It took me 3 calls to corporate office to finally get their asses moving last June and it took them up to the end of October to finally find a massive noise (SNR) issue in the lines. Since Nov 8th of 2015 my cable internet has been garbage. I cannot play any online games on the Xbox one, ports opened, tried DMZ, tried everything you could possibly think of including spending $800 of my own money to buy the best modem router combo, still didn't work. I filed a complaint with the FCC and Comcast said they did everything possible to help me. Everything? Yeah not really. If they did everything I would be able to play with lag-free gaming with 170mbps down and 12 mbps up. The higher-up guy at Comcast sent me a letter stating there's nothing else they can do, so what am I supposed to do now? It is the only ISP in my major area besides Verizon DSL and who wants 2mbps dl that's terrible! As of today June 30, 2016 I have just hooked up their brand new Arris gateway and running constant tracer routes and ping test and am still seeing ping going as high as 350ms. I contacted corporate office today and they said basically ""you pay the money, we do nothing to fix your issue because our techs ran a speed test"". LMAO a speed test WOW! These people just ** on you and they don't care! They did offer to send another tech to run a speed test but I would get charged if they didn't find anything. So I'm basically stuck paying for blast internet and can just search the web on my laptop. Awesome, I got Comcast screwed."
"Jean of Albuquerque, NM","June 24, 2016",1,"When testing speed on Comcast/Xfinity in morning it's 2.60 Mbps and at night it's 1.59 Mbps upload. Download in morning it's 5 Mbps but not enough to stream Netflix and it should be and in evening it's on from 8:30-9:30pm and OFF every night, the download speeds are 1.4 Mbps. There is no reason for such bad speed as I live in the city near the access wi-fi points. They charge you for 10 Mbps and you never get that speed. We have it set up at 405 and I am in 407 a tiny house, two bedroom, duplex stand alone house. CS just hangs up on you and they cannot help you. They blame it on where your modem is placed and I worked for a Cable-Internet company. I know a lot about Modem/Routers. We would change internet providers only it costs too much money to pay for just the hook up. We're seniors being ripped off in Albuquerque."
"Zulma of Weston, FL","June 23, 2016",1,In the complex we live the phone/internet and TV company was being added. The new company is Comcast. We were assured that if in the installation process any damage would our properties by them will be fixed. Comcast damaged our sprinkler's system which resulted in loss of grass and one section which resulted in loss of water pressure and no sprinkler service for a section of the property. We called the association a couple of times and we were assured this issue was forwarded to Comcast. We spoke to Comcast twice and they said the would address it. In the mean time to prevent further damage we had to replace our sprinklers system.
"shira of Atlanta, GA","June 17, 2016",1,"I signed up for internet and was told I would be able to use wifi until my modem arrived. My wifi wasn't working and then when I called back they told me that I was signed up for the wrong plan and that my original plan was no longer available, did I want to continue service for another $20 a month... So I canceled."
"Robert of Richmond, CA","April 10, 2016",1,Comcast is blocking NBA games airing on TBS and ESPN via Sling TV that are also aired on Comcast Sports Network. This is illegal.
"Viedettanne of Coatesville, PA","March 24, 2016",1,"C.S. called with an offer regarding triple play, sounded good so I went for it. Was not told correct amount so I cancelled & now I have to pay the bill that is 1/2 of my monthly check or have service terminated."
"Will of Sarasota, FL","Feb. 4, 2016",1,"In the last couple of months I have more and more trouble with Comcast or is it Xfinity to keep my Internet connection. My Internet connection is disconnected at least 10 times per day and it getting worse. When I call Comcast or is it Xfinity? It's just always the same. We can do some troubleshooting... That's it. I paid already for a technician even I had this insurance but they told me I did something wrong so the insurance wasn't valid and I paid approximately $75 extra.The Internet page of Comcast... After 1 click it become Xfinity... Is extremely user unfriendly and extremely slow. Sometimes when I clicked on a button I don't know what happens until I see everything (the software/Internet page) is working and waiting... The Internet page of Comcast is just a bunch of... I don't know, because I have to click a dozen time and I need a lot of look to find something useful. Next time I try the same way I am always lost and always on other pages. For me it looks like Comcast WANT that the customer get lost. The Internet presence is just trash, sorry but it is.Calling Comcast (or is it Xfinity) is extremely annoying because first a machine ask you a lot questions and you have to enter a lot of numbers. One minute later you will talk with another machine but this machine ask you the same questions again and you have to enter the same number again. Today I was talking 5 (five) minutes until I came to the waiting loop and I waited 5 more minutes. If I could I would change immediately the Internet provider but Comcast has a monopoly in my area."
"Jared of Schaumburg, IL","Jan. 17, 2016",1,"On Xbox One on GTA 5 I join a game for 5 mins and LAG out. I finally join a game after 10 mins!!!! Join 7 mins LAGGED OUT!!!! I called with there bad AI on the phone, got to a guy after 7 mins and tell him why is my bill so high and he tells me because it's good internet and I'm like NO it's not *hangs up on me*. ):< So I skype my friend and disconnected after 15 mins so I did nothing about it. So I played MC by myself and several lag makes me lose 6 games in a row and then my internet goes out. 10 mins later it come back on and called them once more and I called them at 3:24 PM and talked to a guy and he put me on hold until 5:00 and I hanged up and 12 mins later my friend skypes me and it took me 4 mins until he heard my voice. Me back on GTA 5 can't and it took 4 mins to find a lobby and even then I LAG out and my friend is having fun and I'm sitting waiting. When I join his game I get a time TO NOT WAIT but after 27 mins later my internet goes out - no storm, no wind, nothing. I want to change my internet but I can't so I'm so mad that I asked my friend for HIS INTERNET. It's not Xfinity. So I play GTA 5 and it takes 1 min to join his game. 3 hours later skype goes out and I call him back. No probs, played MC, no lobby lag, SOOO happy."
"J. E. of Lisle, IL","Jan. 13, 2016",1,"Three times in the last few weeks the internet has gone down. Guess what Comcast? I work from home and NEED internet access to do my job. Having such outages is bad enough, but when you pay for the highest speed... that is what you should receive. NOT a happy customer at all, and I'm quite sure my boss won't be too thrilled either. So sick of your ads that state you have stellar service. It's all trash and you guys know it. I'll be calling in a bit to make you aware of my plight."
"Mike of Saint Paul, MN","Dec. 22, 2015",1,"Here's the recap of our joyous experience and ongoing saga. I've had well over 15 hours of customer service calls, fun times! We switched our business to a home office and cancelled residential account yet were still billed for about 6 months on the residential account. The offshore tech support in the Philippines that I generally always get sent to has really poor English communication skills. We were told that we would be credited for the past 6 months of being double billed and that credit would go to our business account yet our service was shut off for being unpaid and having an outstanding balance. Internet continues to get packet loss issues and the service is about as reliable as my 28.8 kb/s AOL service in 1996."
"sean of Sacramento, CA","Dec. 15, 2015",1,"Worst oversea customer services & I got 20 yrs experience in sales! And comcast hired bunch of oversea tried to upsale me! You got to be kidding? They couldn't close the deal 8 out of 10. I don't understand what they're trying to says. Simple lost connections. Overall Xfinity/Comcast need to fired the ceo or corrupted insider, to start new quality control, to become best & profit company can serve public correctly & honestly. Please read this xfinity/Comcast!!! Nothing but frustration to your customers."
"CARL of Holly, MI","Dec. 14, 2015",1,"One of my checks that was written for the month of Oct. didn't arrive in time, so they called me and made me pay by credit card right away, so they wouldn't cut-off my service. So I paid it right away. Went to bank to try and chase down lost check. Well guess what? Comcast must have either found this check or it arrived late. So they went and cashed this check also, which should have made me good for the next month's billing cycle. Nope, I was wrong. They sent me another bill for $39.00 for a late fee.So I called them and tried to speak with a customer service person, but she could barely speak English and kept repeating the same sentence three times. It didn't seem to sink in with her so I just hung up. The only reason I went with Comcast is because my dish service does not internet where I live. Also I thought that I had signed up for the $99. Triple package. Well this package that I bought turned out to be $142.00 plus change. Boy do they lie, shame on them. Believe me if I could get out from under this package, I would."
"Dale of Williamsport, PA","Nov. 25, 2015",1,"Trying to get Comcast to service your home is an unfathomable hill unless you live in an extremely populated area where they know they can get instant service from a large amount of people. I have tried to have a site survey done to see if they could provide internet service in my location. I was told this should not take more than 2 weeks at the most. I called multiple times and each representative told me the same thing, ""It should have been done by now"" and then they would mention to wait a few more days before submitting to their supervisor and they would call me back with results. After a few days, no call. I called them back and get the response ""I can't believe no ones updated you on this"". And finally they submit a note to their supervisor and promise to call me back. I call them back and after over a month of waiting and getting the same answer from each rep I'm told there was a decision showing they cannot service because they are not the cable company in the area. They gave me the name of another unheard of company. I gave that company a call to find they have been bought out by another company who currently is not offering internet in the area and the company before never offered it in the first place. I have never heard of these other companies and Comcast is the only cable company everyone including 2 people on my street has. I called back Comcast again and told them this new info and of course they opened another ticket for me which means I will have to wait another month and call over and over to have no results again. Not to mention in between I called numerous times and each rep seemed to have different information, and one time I was told no ticket for me even existed. So I hung up, called back for another rep and they found it right away."
"Ryan of Sewell, NJ","Nov. 12, 2015",1,I signed up with xfinity and had no working service for 37 of the first 44 days. I called everyday trying to get it to work. In addition to not having the service they had a line running across the front of my yard that was not buried and 2 kids tripped over it. They still did not send anyone out to fix that. With my bill I was charged for the installation fee of $350 upfront when it was supposed to be monthly. When I attempted to get that fixed they charged me an additional $350 plus the $58 monthly fee. I have called numerous times to fix it and when I show my frustration the call magically hangs up and nothing gets accomplished. I have spent over 10 total hours on the phone and have a bill for over $600 still. Do yourself and stay away they are frauds because I heard them same story from 3 different people.
"Christine of Oak Park, IL","Nov. 9, 2015",1,I initially signed up for internet only - 105 Mbps at a new customer rate of $39.99. That same evening I decided to add cable. After multiple calls with Customer Service I was finally quoted a double play package at a reduced rate. I called the day before my installation to confirm the channels I was suppose to get. After the guy hooked everything up and left I realized I wasn't getting all the channels so I called customer service. I spent over an hour on this call just to be sold a different package at a higher price. I was also told by the Supervisor that they are not responsible for what the consumer are sold/told by customer service and they wouldn't honor it.They pulled the calls but after the first call he was bored and offered me a $40.00 credit for 3 months but that would only be for the new upgraded package. I contact customer service again Monday morning and was made to feel like I was just creating my own price points. I've filed a claim with the BBB. I felt like this was clearly a bait and switch scheme by Comcast
"patrick of Dunnellon, FL","Nov. 6, 2015",1,"Today I received a letter from Sears canceling my long term credit relationship with them because I had a collections issue with Equifax. After looking at my credit file, Comcast turned me in for collections on an account I have never had with them. The account was not mine and how could they report me without my SS number is beyond me. It has now taken my credit score down almost 100 points and I am fighting it."
"Laura of Canton, MI","Oct. 22, 2015",1,"I have never experienced such bad customer service from a company. I moved to a new city wanted to get Internet Service. They talked me into getting Internet and Phone service as it was cheaper than getting the Internet alone. They told me someone could come out in a week and half. Pretty long time but ok. The technician Andrew came out and then told me they could not install as there was no line coming to the house. There is a concrete walkway in the backyard leading to the deck. So he said a contractor would have to come out and lay a line under the concrete. Then they could come out again.So days passed no word from them. I call they say ""oh you are pending."" We will have someone call you in 24hrs to make an appointment. She calls back later and says ""oh you need a special permit to lay that line it will take two more weeks."" I tell her I really need the Internet for job related reasons. Candice says ""oh you can use Infinity wifi if you see it on your smart phone. I do so she sets me up with an ID and password.""I get off the phone and try to connect. No luck. I then talk to Danielle who tries to help me connect. She has no luck so she sends me to a technician that has more knowledge than she does. She then passes me on to a hotspot expert. Well by now I can connect but it is only like 1 mbps. So basically you can do nothing with it. She says she can't help and sends me on to the next person. I say you aren't sending me back to the very beginning. Sure enough she does. As I am talking to this person and please realize I have to tell the whole story each time I talk to a new person. This person says you can't get wifi unless you have service set up. Grrr. All that time wasted with these people. As I am talking who is in my backyard but two Comcast guys to lay the line. What happened to needing a permit or two weeks?They say the technician doesn't know what he is talking about you have a line all along. They say they will make a note about it. Just as I am getting ready to call them the next day there is a knock on the door. Three guys from Comcast are there to bury the line. What line it was buried long ago with the previous owners. No communication between the different departments. I call to them about the developments and when can they come out and connect the service in the house. They tell me it will take two weeks. I say you should give me faster service after all this hassle and a discount on my first month of service. They said ""oh we can't do that."" I say let me talk to your supervisor. They say ""oh the supervisor is not here they will call you back in two hours."" Oh by the way some technician cancelled my account so I have to start all over with a second credit check. Unbelievable. No one calls back.I call after I did not get a call back sounds like I have called Mexico with all the Spanish speaking going on. I explain the whole situation again Danny says ""Oh I have talked to the department and they will get you service tomorrow. They will call you around 10:30 am and be there by the end of the day at 6:30."" I did talk to a supervisor then and he assured me as well that someone would come the next day. He said he could not give me a discount on my account because it is not active yet. I say why don't you give me a credit on the account. He says I have to talk to accounting. No one calls the next day or comes.I call to see what happened and they say ""oh they can't tell you a specific time I am going to write them up."" I am now talking to an office in the Philippines. She says they will still have to keep the appointment 2 weeks from now but will try to fit me in sometime before that. So basically I would be on call for two weeks. Next day I call. Wow. They set me up with the Internet at a reasonable rate. Plus they came out the very next day. They came and Ken did an excellent job. Service is working great. Stay away from Comcast if you can."
"Marty of Atlanta, GA","Oct. 18, 2015",2,"I was a customer with Comcast. They lied about the discount. Was suppose to have someone do the work so I could get internet service, but he didn't do the work. So, they had to send a tech over after I waited for service for four days. They said there would be no charge for the tech coming out since it was their fault that my service was not ready. Wrong! They charged me for everything. They gave me a discount for 12 months then automatically signed me up for the next year without my consent. The bill was getting higher and higher so I called them. The customer service person told me that the discount they gave me for the past twelve months was added to my bill and each month they charged extra until it was paid. How can these people get away with this? It is as though no one can stop these crooks from their crooked business dealings. I need an internet service. All of them are liars and crooks!!!"
"T of Arnold, MD","Sept. 28, 2015",1,"I cancelled my account with them on 8/22/15 due to their incompetence. Was told I would receive my final bill soon, which I did. The final bill was due by 9/23/15; no problem, I actually paid it in full on 9/25/15. I received a letter from a collection agency dated 9/17/15 that I needed to pay immediately for they now were handling my account/case, mind you this letter reached me on 9/26/15, yet dated 9/17. Idiots.Complete lack of common sense and customer service in regards to all their employees not to mention you cannot send a person to collections if they have not missed their due date! I would have given them a negative ""star"" if able to. I hope people realize sooner than later to go with other companies or simply ""unplug"". Needless to say I nor anyone I speak with will ever be their customer again, for I have yet to speak with someone who actually has something positive to say on their behalf. Good riddance."
"Sherzod of Pittsburgh , PA","Sept. 26, 2015",1,"They charged me EFT return fee. They cannot explain the reason. All they say is, ""Call your bank."" My bank said there was not any charge from Comcast. I called 5-6 agents. They all said they can't see why there is a charge. I wasted 2-3 hours of my time."
"Nelson of Marietta, GA","Sept. 25, 2015",1,"I am sadly upset with lie after lie from Customer Services Agents and Supervisors. On September 20, I spoke with a female agent, who offered me a package of internet service plus Latino TV for $ 34.99 (no signed contract), and she stated that this amount will be kept for 24 months. I was driving and could not finish my deal with that female agent.On September 21, about 1:00 PM, I spoke with a male agent, who again offered me a 24 months no contract 3 GB internet service plus 119 Latino TV, plus many English Channels, including all Nickelodeon, all Disney Channels, Food Network and GSN (Games Show Network) Channel plus 2 HD boxes for $ 34.99 with an special technician, who will come to my house to install everything for extra $ 5.00 dollars. The male agent scheduled me for a technician visit for September 23, and said that the technician will bring the 2 HD boxes, and then he complimented: ""on September 22, you will receive a phone call from the technician to inform you what time on September 23 he or she will be there.""Last night (September 22) after no phone call received from the technician, I called Comcast Customer Service, and spoke with a Supervisor, who apologized about the 2 agents lies, since Comcast has not 24 months agreement with no one. Also, he informed me that no appointment was made, no 2 HD boxes were added, no special channels; but he said that he will be add the extra box (since the liar male (and female too) agents offered 2 HD boxes), and also he made the appointment for today September 23, between 1:00 to 3:00 PM.Today at 2:45 PM, I called Comcast Customer Service, and a female agent said, that the technician will be in my home about 3:20 PM. I called again at 4 PM, and spoke with an agent named Luis, who asked for my phone number since his supervisor will call me immediately. It is 5:00 PM, and no technician showed up, no agents and/or supervisors answer my phone calls, and I am in the limbo, since I disconnected my Dish TV service, expecting to have Comcast TV Service at 3:00 PM.It is very suspicious, that 2 agents, in two different occasions in two different days offered me a 24 months package, if Comcast never had that kind of agreement. I believe that those two poor liars agents, among others, had been trained by Comcast's Supervisor to sell those kind of lies to clients. And now, no technician, no agent, no supervisor, no Comcast TV, no Dish TV, and nobody is responsible for inefficiencies/ineptitudes /inadequacies within the soul of Comcast.Finally Comcast technician came at 6 PM, disconnected my internet services, used all previous Dish TV cables, asked me to move and remove furniture from 2 bedrooms and clothes from a closet, unrolled white and black co-axial cables inside and outside of the house, and suddenly I saw him packing his tools, without saying a word. When he was in his truck, I asked him: ""Are you leaving and have not internet and not TV?"" He got out of his car, and connected my internet, and then said: ""Tomorrow, I will be back or a new technician for TV purposes"", and left, leaving on the floor, bunches of connected cables to TV.Comcast agents and supervisors, just ""apologized again, as usual"", and nothing was resolved. Next day, September 24, no one from Comcast appeared, called, and no TV and one's responsibility. I am elevating my voice protesting with this Comcast's disorganizations and bundle of poor thing liars agents and (and do not know what to say about the Supervisors, who supposedly to be the example for those low IQ liars agents), and incompetent unrespectable, unconscious technicians (but to expect of this miserable company?) Expecting that this cause some shaking and roll heads of the Comcast's handful agents and Supervisors, who maintain Comcast's ineffectiveness, and are direct responsible of those."
"Pranav of Chicago, IL","Sept. 25, 2015",1,"I opened an account on the 9th September and my account got disconnected without my permissions on 21st September. After over 10 hours on the call and chat, nobody could figure out what happened and I was told the account is dead. So finally the resolution was that I open a new account which I did as of 24th September. I called later in that night to activate my modem, which I own, and they activated the service. When I wake up today I see that they activated the service on the account which was apparently disconnected on error. Now I have 2 accounts at the same location with the service I don't want.Cancelling an account without my consent was breach in my privacy. Also, Xfinity/Comcast made a hard credit check without my consent which is another major breach of my privacy. Every time I talk to an agent they give some new info. If nothing happens soon, I will be forced to sue Comcast for mental harassment."
"John of Santa Fe, NM","Sept. 12, 2015",1,"Every time you call Comcast you have to suffer through minutes of pushing buttons, no one is ever available with whom to speak. You get run through the mill with advertisements and requests to spend even more than you are currently charging for monthly services. When you get someone on the telephone most staff is out of country and frequently cannot communicate unless they read pages of information printed in front of them. Frequently, you are transferred to a second individual and often the phone connection is disconnected. Thus, one has to start all over with listening to the worse automated information doing nothing but constantly aggravating you. I believe it is your subconscious goal to aggravate all of your customers since you have such a monopoly. Any other corporation has to be better than you. Scale of 1 to 10, you rank with everyone who has you in a minus category lower than one."
"Vic of Santa Cruz, CA","Sept. 9, 2015",1,"So I was without internet for 4 days before I was able to finally schedule a service call (they said there was a general outage in my area and once that was fixed my internet service would be restored as well. It was not hence the need for a service call). I scheduled to take time off work so I could be home for the technician. After waiting 2 hours he never showed up. I called Comcast and they said my appt. was cancelled. They never notified me it was cancelled. I was very mad. They said they would send a guy out to check the pole and verify service was available. This would occur between 8am and 8pm the next day. If there were any questions they would call me. Well I had taken the day off so I thought maybe there was a chance it would get fixed. Around 6 that night I call and say that I'm still without internet service. They told me they cancelled the pole guy.Huh. Why? ""Oh you have a problem with your router and need a new one since we cannot contact it"". This state of affairs had been verified several times already which I believe was the reason for the pole guy to begin with. So I go to the Comcast store and return my ""defective"" cable box. While I'm there I get a text saying I can save myself 10 a month by buying a cable box. So I run over to a chain and grab a router and register MAC address with Comcast. Still no internet. Call Comcast again. ""Oh you will need a technician. Let's schedule you an appt."" Well there were no slots available over the weekend so I schedule to take time off work again.I'm at home cleaning the carpet. I noticed a call. It is Comcast telling me the technician showed up but no one was home. Yes Comcast there were people there. So I get on the phone and demand they send him back. Twice they say they will call me back with an ETA. Both times they fail to call me back. I finally get a supervisor and he tells me they only work between 8 and 6 on weekdays. Well I'm not about to take more time off. So I schedule for the coming weekend. We will see if they show up, can fix the problem or if this is dragged out for a few more weeks.What strikes me about this encounter with Comcast is their 1st level employees are all reading from scripts. They just keep spouting the various scripts until you give up or do what they want. It really is like talking to machine that is responding to keywords to determine the script they will read from. When I compare this process to T-mobile's 1st level help, who I was talking with during the same time period since I needed to buy more data from them until Comcast fixed my internet service, it is just night and day. The T-mobile reps took action instead of trying to delay the need to make a commitment.The other thing that stood out about Comcast is just how unconcerned they are about customers. They canceled a schedule appt. without contacting me and then after I went ballistic they offered me $15. Which I think is what they owed me for the number of days at that point I was without internet service. They did not care that I lost a total of 5 hours of work time (two 2 hour appointments and needing to leave 30 minute early for each appt.) and they repeatedly ignored my request for compensation for the lost work time. If they had shown up I'd be OK with taking time off. But they just blew me off and that shows a real lack of respect towards their customers. My goal now is to find an alternative service. And convince everyone I know how much better that alternative is to Comcast."
"Makoto of Bellevue, WA","Sept. 4, 2015",1,"Cable box malfunctioned (2 months of ""We'll send signal to correct it""). Returned the box at Factoria (Bellevue, WA) service center on Aug 3, 2015. My turn was skipped. When I complained, a staff told me that ""I called your name 3 times and you were not paying attention"" - not true. When I said (sorry to lose my temper, but...), ""that's **"", that staff tells me to ""Shut your mouth"". Called the manager to complain. Jacob ** never returned my 7 voicemails or 2 emails. Escalated the complaint to corporate (""executive escalation""). ** calls on Aug 24, with excuses that his phone has been malfunctioning for 2 months (hmm, corporate sure got through) and he did reply to my emails - hmm, nope. Both corporate and ** promises credits. But, have not seen any on my statements. Apologies from staff and management were promised, but none received. In the meantime, I was billed for a DVR service which I have never had. Called to have the bill corrected, and the call center in India removes that DVR and my HD signal. No TV service for 4 days. (Finally corrected by in-house tech service). Yes, I may get some credit, but no evidence thus far."
"Astra of Westminster, CO","Sept. 2, 2015",1,I was a previous customer of Comcast about 5-6 years ago. In May of 2015 I contacted Comcast to inquire about internet service. I spoke via chat to a salesperson to get information. I never completed any order. I never activated any service. But on 09/01/15 I received a bill for 169.00. I contacted Comcast and they said I had to file a fraud complaint and police report because someone was fraudulently using my information. I had recently pulled a credit report and had no other unusual activity on my credit report. I believe the salesperson opened this account with my prior information. I have four email from Comcast that show I never completed any order. However I have to do all this work of filing these reports when Comcast most likely knows this was an inside job.
"Colleen of Southfield, MI","Aug. 31, 2015",1,I recently tried to switch to Comcast from AT&T to get faster internet speed. I ordered the self install kit which I was supposed to be able to plug in and login to activate with current service lines... That didn't work. I called to have it installed by one of their technicians; When I went to setup my Smart TV to connect to the WiFi it wouldn't connect. After spending 2 hours on the phone troubleshooting I was told it was the TV and I would need to contact their troubleshooting department. What kind of service can't connect the WiFi to a TV? I called to then cancel the service. I don't have the time to have them keep coming out to correct it when it should have been done at the time of install. After all that's said and done I was billed $125 for what... No service and a huge headache. Absolutely unbelievable. When I called to question why I was billed it was for the service (that I never had). I will not recommend Xfinity to anyone for any reason. AT&T has great customer service and they're reliable. I wish a little faster internet but I will take it any day over dealing with Comcast Xfinity ever again.
"cathy of North Port, FL","Aug. 21, 2015",1,"You know I have had Comcast/Xfinity service forever and no matter where I moved to I never had a problem keeping my email address. In the last 7 yrs I have moved 3x and the last 2 addresses I lived at where I had created the email and then where I moved to I had no problem taking it w/ me but now this past May I had to move and the email was fine until this week. I received email up to 10:17 pm on Monday night. When I couldn't access my email on Tues I called Comcast. I verified my last 2 previous addresses that I lived at where I used this email and I was told by Wednesday night I would have my email transferred to my new acct.Mind you it took 5 phones calls on Tues. but guess what it didn't happen on Wednesday so I called them again and again and again... Do you know since Tues morning I have been on the phone w/ Comcast for a total of 20 hrs. Finally tonight I called again at 513 pm which lasted for 2hrs 18 mins bc my email is still not transferred and guess what they are telling me that they have to call me tomorrow to verify my last 2 previous addresses again even though I have verified it every day since I've called on Tues... Jesus Christ doesn't even expect me to verify myself this much. Mind you for the last 3 days I have given them that info every time I spoke to or was transferred to someone... I believe I must've been transferred to 10 people including a supervisor tonight on this 2 hr 18 min phone call and can I tell you that my issue is still pending and not resolved... that's what they call great customer service.Now I have to wait til tomorrow, verify my last 2 addresses and then it will take 72 hrs to appear on my acct. It's a good thing I'm NOT dying or counting on an important email. Can I tell you that as soon as I can get out of this contract I am transferring my internet service to Verizon since I already have cell phone service w/ them and they don't treat their customers like this. I have had Verizon since 2002 so that's where I'll be taking my internet service. Before you decide to transfer to Comcast check out your options bc yea they are a large company but their customer service stinks. I work for Walmart and I know all about customer service and how to treat and take care of the customer. Sorry Comcast but you failed and receive a F in taking care of the customer. Everyone deserves good customer service no matter where or who you work for."
"Charlyne of Fargo, ND","Aug. 11, 2015",1,"When I called to establish service they had to call me back. Their ""system"" was too slow to tell me if I was in their area. I then spent 30 minutes going through their options and establishing service. I received a call the next day and was told that even though I had set up a installation date and established service with them they could not come out and connect service on the first of the month because there was already service at the house. Until that was cancelled they could not install mine. I have moved numerous times and I have never heard this before. The representative was unwilling to try to explain the issue in a way that made any sense and would not let me speak to a manager. In the end, I told him that I did not want service through Xfinity and would find another provider."
"megan of Denver, CO","Aug. 9, 2015",1,"Comcast is the worst business in this world. Don't EVER do business with them. We got their internet service (only because barely any other services are available in our area)... I was dreading it but we needed the internet. We set it up ourselves and it worked fine for the first 2 weeks. All the sudden it stopped working for no reason. We called someone to come out here and they didn't tell us it would cost a dime. After waiting a week for them to send someone out, my boyfriend waited at home all day from the 8am-11pm timeframe they gave us. They showed up an hour after; he obviously was out running errands after sitting all day waiting for them. We had to call to reschedule. Another 5 days went by before they could someone out for a second time. They ended up fixing the internet. However they screwed up our TV (DirecTV who is awesome!) and WE had to end up paying DirecTV to come out here to fix what Comcast screwed up. We cancelled our service with Comcast before our month was even up and I was told by not one, but two different (surprisingly nice and helpful) customer service representatives that they were sorry for our trouble, ""it sounds terrible"" and that we wouldn't be charged anything for the service. What a joke. They ended up sending us to collections for $94.76. My boyfriend paid it so it wouldn't hurt his credit. I called and spoke with Comcast and THE RUDEST person was ""helping me"" and told me that it ""didn't matter what the other people had told me and this is the way it is."" Now looking through the bill I'm also seeing some ** ""Failed CHSI Sik"" charge for $99.99. Which would mean what, exactly, Comcast?? The most **, shady company in the industry. We hate them so much that we literally would rather not have the internet at all than work with Comcast. And in this day in age you can imagine how tough that is. But I refuse to give that miserable place another penny. Don't ever do business with them. The only reason they are still in business is because there are not many other options out there. Just remember Comcast, Karma is a **. Can't wait to see you slowly fail."
"don of Brentwood, TN","July 31, 2015",1,"So they tell me now that I'm getting 75 mbps internet speed. And often I do. But then again, often I end up with .35 mbps.. that's point 35. Slow enough that my internet service is useless and I have to leave my home to continue with my job. For years they have been coming to my house, trying to charge me $75 per trip to fix THEIR ISSUE. It's intermittently messed up so by the time they get around to helping me, it's ok again. And then they say things like, ""it's hard to fix something when it's ok when we get here."" (I send them speed reports to prove it was slow.) The supervisors say they will do what it takes to fix it and then they do nothing.When the techs get here they say things like, ""we saw the issues you are having in the office on our equipment so we know you are having issues"" but then nothing ever gets fixed. I'M SICK OF IT BUT I REFUSE TO GIVE UP. I DEMAND THAT I GET THE SERVICE THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY PROVIDE. AND I REFUSE TO GO TO A LESSER SPEED SYSTEM LIKE DISH OR AT&T."
"George of Bastrop, TX","July 31, 2015",1,"I called the Comcast Xfinity hotline to get internet only (no TV, no home phone). There was no option to set it up online. The rep put me on hold for about 10 min to ""put some packages together."" Then she claimed that the best option for me was a promotional package 75mb/sec for $39.99 plus monthly $10 for modem rental. I explained that I already had a modem that I would want to use. I told her that this was quite expensive and asked if she had something cheaper. She replied that the only other ""package"" she had was for $29.99 for 6mb/sec. All in all she was a bit snotty during our conversation and was quick to hang up after I said I want to explore other providers."
"Kelly of Pontiac, , MI","July 20, 2015",2,"Customer placed on hold over 30 minutes waiting to talk to comcast rep. 1.) Conversation interrupted frequently several times during conversation. Each time dialed for reconnect, a long time waiting period (over 30- minutes). 2.) Recording voice process flawed ""limited choices to solution."" 3.) Voice refers to comcast rep. 4.) Additional waiting time - over 30 minutes waiting time again. There were 3-day wait before my problem was solved!! And service interrupted (3) days."
"Adam of Portland, TN","July 17, 2015",1,"Signed up for Blast 75Mbps service at $39.99, Comcast changed it. I have a confirmation in writing: ""XFINITY Internet Blast! Internet Promotional Rate. Promotional Rate for 12 months."" When they installed, speed test showed 29Mbps. Called customer service immediately and they say we are signed up for Performance Internet. They say they will not provide the original agreement and we would have to sign up for a different package. I cancelled the same day."
"Sorrelle of Evanston, IL","July 17, 2015",1,I called Comcast/Xfinity in the middle of June regarding the slow speed of our internet service. The agent immediately said she would send someone out. SHE DID NOT TELL ME THERE WOULD BE A $70.00 CHARGE. The service person came and told me there wasn't anything he could do. And if I wanted faster speed I should try taking my laptop to the modem and sit next to it! I called to complain when I saw that there was a charge for that visit. The rep said she'd see if they would remove it because I wasn't informed of the charge beforehand. Never heard back. Called back today and was told they'd give me a $20.00 credit and that I'd have to pay the rest. My contract is up in December and I am choosing to end my service with them and get rid of Xfinity altogether! I'll use Roku for everything. Poor Comcast they don't make enough $$$???!!!
"Brian of Crystal Lake, IL","July 16, 2015",1,"My wife and I WERE going to change our internet/cable service. I took the day off of work to be home for the appointment. My wife gave the rep scheduling the appointment my contact info and also put me on the ""account"" so I could interact with Comcast. The rep did NOT take any of my info and log it in. Day of installation appointment, they called my wife to say no one was home at 1:14 P.M. The garage door and the front door were WIDE open and clearly visible from the street (50 feet from edge of street). By 1:16 P.M., my wife had given them my number, and they found the time in 2 minutes to call and leave a message saying that I would have to reschedule. I filed a complaint with the BBB. They attempted to contact me after I had previously (7 days earlier) told them to remove my number and email from their database. They still wanted me to establish service with them which would require me to take more time off work (unacceptable) and offered a $25 credit. What an insult. Never doing business with them. EVER."
"karen of Toms River, NJ","July 9, 2015",1,This has got to be THE WORST internet service EVERRRR. So slow. Have Chromecast and the Movies have to reload every three Minutes (that's being generous). It takes like five to ten Minutes and I have to restart. Takes like three hrs or more to watch a normal length movie. To search the web... also takes more than double time. I usually turn off wifi and just use Sprint which also sucks but NOT AS BAD AS COMCAST!! That's sad. Your internet sucks and cable costs way too much. Unfortunately it's my only choice. Can't wait for fios to be available. :-) :-) :-)
"lizdaris of Waukegan, IL","June 30, 2015",3,"I had a previous bill with them and they send me to collections - 1400 dollars. I call and I wanted to have a new account, so they promise me to start me up with a 0 balance. They call me and say ""yes, 0 balance"" 3 times before they then came. I ask again if it was going to be 0 balance, they told me again yes. On the same day of connecting the toll, me: 0 balance. Well when the bill came in it was for $528, so I have call - spend over seven hours on call and now they tell me it was a previous balance that was not paid. I ask them, still no help with this. So why they tell you all this and set you up for failure again?"
"Emma of Pembroke Pines, FL","June 9, 2015",1,"First, I updated the internet to Business, expecting to have a faster speed. Nothing has change but the bill, yes went up very high. The home phone was added to the business and have it back to the residential took me 2 months and several calls. Finally I have it back, but they gave me a temporary number while they make the changes. Guess what? When I make phone calls, the number that appears in the callers ID's is not mine - is the temporary one. Usually my bank pay my bills, but this month I check the Comcast bill and noticed charges for services that I never asked for. They keep billing me for the internet besides the bill I pay for the Business. Double charges. This is the worst company I ever had. Thinking in change to another internet provider."
"Rafiqul of Boston, MA","May 31, 2015",1,"Comcast is terrible. I don't usually do reviews, but this time I feel that the potential Comcast customers should know what they are getting into once they sign up for Comcast services. I have been with Comcast the past 5 years and I never saw the services so bad. I signed up for a triple play with maximum 125 MBPS blast internet speed. That was what I was told in the beginning. Everything went pretty well till this March when things started to go really awry.First the speed came down to about 40-45 MBPS. But I didn't complain much because it was still good enough for browsing. But in April, 2015 I wanted to watch some cricket matches (the world cup) by live streaming. I just could not get my TV stream anything. I complained to customer services, and after about 5 days they did send out a technician. Have you ever had a Comcast technician come and fix the problem for you? They are so bloody arrogant and make you feel so low. Typical attitude: How stupid are you not to be able to figure out the solution for yourself; They do something and tell you everything will be fine from now. And the problem remains and you have no idea what was the issue and what he fixed. They make you feel like they are bestowing a huge honor just by showing up to your door. They are always out of the door in 5 minutes max. So the problem remained and I complained to customers services again. After another week or so they let me know that maybe the problem is with the router. So they said someone will come and replace the router and everything will be fine.The technician came, installed a new router and was out of my place before the router was actually online. Before leaving, he asked me to get an usb cable and other things from Amazon to speed up my services. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about when I am supposed to have a wireless connection for all devices and I have a small apartment and all devices are close to the router. Finally I decided I have had enough (my internet speed is now down to 15 MBPS) and I cancelled the services from June 4, 2015. I called them o/a May 24 and schedule return of all equipment. I also pay all my outstanding bills. Imagine my consternation I receive a new bill of $122 for services from June 4 to July 3, 2015. I called the customer services again and somehow navigate my way to speak to someone at the payments department. I tell him my problem and he asks me to call cancellation department and resolve this. I request him to send a note to cancellation department or maybe talk to them internally to resolve my problem. He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up. I guess in order to not be charged with bills for services not received, I shall have to call them again. So sad. Comcast used to be a good company. Next time I will choose a smaller service provider who will attend to my needs and solve my problem. I wish some of us will get together and file a class action suit to hold these Company to better standards. You pay a lot and in return you are treated so bad that it hurts."
"Diane of Snellville, GA","May 29, 2015",1,The internet service and phone service frequently went out. I requested help and was told a technician would come out and there would be no charge. It was discovered that the initial was incorrect and that we had a very poor signal due to a reversal of equipment that was placed in the box on the outside of our home. It was fixed on the second visit by the technician. Comcast charged $70 for a technical call and refused to reverse the charge until I called to cancel the service.
"rob of Granger, IN","May 14, 2015",1,"The internet I pay for is awful. I pay a premium for what should be a premium service (blast internet speeds -- 50 Mbps), and don't receive anything close to acceptable. Comcast internet is an absolute scam."
"Tom of Malverne, NY","May 11, 2015",1,"Comcast is basically inept. As an owner of residential properties in South Florida, I have cause to subscribe to the internet for seasonal tenants. Comcast is not set up for this. What surprises me is that with as many rental property's that are in South Florida, you would think that they deal with situations such as this where there's policy and procedures. They can't get it right the first time ever. Last year I attempted to pay for the complete service in advance, and have the service turned off automatically. They can't do this. When you live in another city and attempt to resolve issues for your own account, they need your account number. There's no way to get it. Unless you have the account # you can't help yourself, and if you are not in S. Florida, you can't just pop into one of their offices and help yourself. It took me between 25 and 30 telephone hours last year only to wind up with a second account when the dust settled and I had to start over. This year, armed with the account number I attempted to pay over the telephone, and they got it wrong again. The details are too arduous to list here. I attempted to pay my tenants internet bill on the telephone and after asking the total amount owed for the entire length of the stay, they still got it wrong. It only took 56 minutes this time to get to a resolution, (We'll see) but I needed to acquiesce to paying a reinstallation of my TV service just to save having to get onto another department. This, even though I pay for the TV as part of my HOA maintenance fee. They never should have turned off my TV in the first place! I've never been late with my condo maintenance!! In the case of my internet commitment, I attempted to pay in full 3 days after I asked to have it shut down (BTW, they didn't do that either) and they were still billing me for the subsequent month of April!I thought all that I went through was possibly because I'm an imbecile, but last month at a gathering of 30 people up in Sebastian, FL, someone brought up the topic of the ineptitude of Comcast, and all hell broke loose. Everyone in attendance was attempting to top the prior complaining attendee with yet another tale of woe from their own past Comcast experiences. This actually made me feel better as it's an indication that Comcast is actually poorly run and it wasn't me!So, without other recourse in dealing with this monopoly, I can only attempt to warn others. When you speak to a Comcast employee, first ask for their name and company ID. For you see, if the call becomes too difficult for them they just drop you off the line and you will need to start over. Thanks to you who have read this. I hope that my comments help to preclude the loss of time patience and money of other unsuspecting Comcast consumer."
"Greg of Pittsburgh, PA","April 10, 2015",1,"WARNING: Under no circumstances should you consider Xfinity Home Security. We recently installed Xfinity Home Security in our home in San Francisco. The Comcast representative knew we would be moving soon to Pittsburgh PA and assured us that we could transfer our service. Nothing could be further from the truth. We had to battle for weeks to get the service transferred and we had a horrible battle over an early termination fee. Comcast incorrectly billed us twice for installation and we spent days and days on the phone with call center people who could not correct the problem. In the meantime, we needed to disconnect the system for 4 to 6 months while we renovated our home. Comcast refused to discontinue the billing while we had the system shut down. Keep in mind we are paying our Comcast bill at our other address in Pittsburgh.After a two-month battle with Comcast, we gave up and returned our Comcast equipment. Comcast told us we needed to return the additional motion detectors we had paid for. We received no refund for the equipment that we had purchased. Several weeks later, we get a call from Comcast Customer Solutions now saying they would consider allowing us a six-month billing delay while we renovated. We asked them how could we ever get our bill corrected? They didn't know. We asked them if we would now be charged for a third installation fee? They did not know. We asked them if we were going to have to buy the additional motion detectors again? They did not know. We respectfully asked them to forgive the early termination fee and they said THEY WOULD PURSUE US FOR THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE.Keep in mind, I am paying a monthly fee for Comcast services at my current address. I asked ** if the several hundred dollar early termination fee was worth losing a customer who will be paying Comcast for another 20 or 30 years and he said the early termination fee was more important. We have been a Comcast customer for over 25 years and we are winding down ALL of our services with Comcast. On a scale of 0 to 10, there is not a number low enough to rate Comcast."
"T of Laplace, LA","March 25, 2015",1,"After 3 times of a Comcast tech tried to fix the issues with cable and Internet I switched. Trying to get an actual person off the phone took between 45 minutes to 2.5 hours. I finally had to drop off all the equipment off at their local branch. I also called my bank to pull the payment from Comcast. Of the 23 days I had their service, if you call it that, I had 3 days of actual cable TV and Internet."
"Katherine of Grand Rapids, MI","March 17, 2015",1,"I had internet through Comcast and was fairly happy with it. However my roommate was interested in trying out TV through them as well. In February, we upgraded our service and ordered the self-install kit. It took almost 2 weeks to get to our residence, they did not even ship it until exactly 7 days after the initial order date. When we received the equipment, the HDMI ports were literally covered up with a sticker and service reps on the phone refused to believe that this could be possible. Finally, they sent out a technician who saw our boxes, was baffled, and explained they must have been faulty. He was very nice and got us new equipment from his truck. The TV was finally working however we were unhappy with the service. Assuming (apparently wrongly) that I was still covered under the money-back guarantee, I call Comcast to downgrade my service back to the internet and after we finally get it worked out. The service rep. says ""oh by the way, you're not covered"" because the change was made to the account 31 days ago. Here's my problem, not only are we being charged for the shipment of the faulty boxes ($9.95), they are also charging us for the technician visit ($39.95) which was only necessary because they sent us faulty equipment! Now, I find out that even though our service didn't get set up until 14 days ago, we have to cover the entirety of what is now a $168 bill."
"Frank of Bonita Springs, FL","March 12, 2015",1,"Called last week to complain about slow Internet (downloads about 1-2Mbs according to Bandwidthplace.com. After IDing myself to their IVR system, I repeated the info to a rep, Told about my problem. Asked all kinds of questions about the modem and router. Said that it was their equipment so they should know all about it. She couldn't help so transferred me to their ""Advanced"" support. Repeated all the ID info and then was asked about the problem. Said that they would try to fix and call back in two days.Obviously, no help so I called back and they scheduled a tech to come on Sat PM. He arrived on time and checked signal strength and said the problem is in their system. Service drop is old and loss is above their standard. He would write a work order to run new service drop and increase signal strength. As you might expect, no improvement so I repeated everything early this PM and will see their service tech on Sat PM. By almost any standard Comcast is the absolute worst company in America. I just wish that the money being spent in DC to get the merger through was spent on improving infrastructure. We can only hope... "
"rosa of Atlantic City, AL","March 9, 2015",1,"I have been a Comcast customer for over 15 years. Customer service have declined. I had appointment March 5, 2015. They never showed nor did they give me a courtesy call. I called, inquiring about the technician. She told me he had to cancel Due to the weather. I ask the women, ""Why didn't anyone call and inform me?"" She said they did. I told her, ""No one called,"" so she reschedule for the next day. I am waiting and waiting so I called. She said, ""They're running late. They're coming."" Another no show. I called and insisting on speaking with management. She put me on hold for forty five minutes only to get back on the phone to tell me her supervisor was too busy to answer the complaint...he would call back. The supervisor never called back. I work from home so I lost money because of this. This company is horrible. I think the problem is the language barrier."
"Carry of Hyde Park, MA","March 8, 2015",1,"I called Comcast to up my internet speed. They told me I would have to pay 12/month for 50 mps. I did not know I was only getting 25 mps with my regular service. I tested my upload/download speed with their utility and I wasn't getting anything better than 32 mps. I called support and spent a total of 10 hours on two calls with tech support. The second call I was transferred 6 times. On the first call, the tech kept saying they could not see my device online so I was not connected to the internet. I told them I was on a VOIP line so it was impossible that I wasn't connected to the internet. This conversation went on for 30 min. I was on a 30 day trial for a new contract. I had been a customer for 17 yrs. They were going to send out a technician but I insisted that I not be charged for this visit no matter what the outcome. No one would commit to that so I canceled the visit. On the day that the visit was supposed to be canceled a guy shows up at my door saying he is with Xfinity home security. He explained that he traveled 2 hours to get to my house and had paperwork that said I called. I told him we don't have the security package, never did. He sat with me for almost an hour and agreed that this was all a major blunder but said to go ahead with the new product installation as I was dropping Comcast and if I wanted to come back he would personally handle the contract. I said fine and the following week had their major competitor installed. Since install I have consistently had 58-63 mps with the internet and that's with 4 laptops, 1 Ipad and two phones. In addition, the competitor bundle of internet, TV and phone is 15$/month cheaper than what I had been paying for all three. Also, I have HD coming in on my TV which I did not have with Comcast. Have to admit that the new service does have less channels but for the price and service it is worth it. Besides, we don't watch a lot of TV anyway."
"Robin of Fort Myers, FL","June 30, 2015",2,"After filing a complaint with https://www.fcc.gov/ & better business bureau I received a call and was credited for my entire account less the 150.00 I paid in advance. I am satisfied with these results. It's sad I have to go to these lengths to correct issue. ** Executive Office Number! If you need it but no help unless you file a complaint with link above. Then you will see results.Original ReviewSigned up for X1 Blast package not quite 2 weeks ago. Was told install was free & I would not receive a bill until 30 days after I started my service. I was told install tech would be here the next day between 5 & 7 pm. I was given my phone number and paid my deposit for all 3 service.The day of the install I received a call saying something went wrong on their end and they would have to reschedule my install for 2 days later. I was not happy with that. I was able to get the next day instead, so I was ok with it. They had to run my deposit again. I confirmed that the phone number they gave me was still going to be the same as original they gave me. I explained I was ordering new card & t-shirts with the new number and wanted to make sure there was no chance of the number being different. I was assured that the number was the same. So I placed my order.The next day when tech showed up I was informed that the number was a different number! After about 4 phone calls and almost 3 hours on the phone with I forget how many different operators trying to get a supervisor, because the operators did not have the authority to correct the number. I just spent 1000.00 on my order! I could not change it due to a mistake on my end. The Supervisor was able to correct it! I was very happy.Not even 2 weeks go by and I get a email from Xfinity saying my video bill was due???? So I watch it and I'm thinking maybe a tutorial on my video bill. WRONG!!! IT WAS A BILL!!! I had a bill over $200.00. It is only supposed to be 112.00 including tax a month. I was charged an additional 39.95 for the installer to show up and 40.00 for hooking 2 cable lines to 2 box's 20.00 a box! So install was 89.95. My house was already wired and ready. I was also charged for half a month's service and tax. I called and was informed that the info the 1st operator told me was not true that they always bill 2 weeks after service and I would get another bill in a few days for a full month service. That on occasions they do offer free install but it was not in my notes. So there was no chance of getting that removed from my bill. I requested that they pull the recording of my conversation with the original representative. I was told it was possible that it was not recorded. HMMM... Imagine that!!She said she would put in a request for her manager to remove the $40.00 but the manager was off till Monday, it was Friday. I was also told that if it was removed it would come off the next bill statement not the current one. She recommended I pay it all now. That the next bill may be adjusted! She said she would call me Tuesday to let me know the decision. It is now Saturday and I have already received another email telling me my bill was due AGAIN! I just got the first bill yesterday! It is not even due till for another 10 days! I am awaiting the call on Tuesday. Will update this on outcome!"
"Ted of Riviera Beach, FL","March 4, 2015",1,"In the beginning...There was installation. I was quoted one price and charged $40 more. This was mitigated by the installer being 4 hours late and being credited $20 against the $40 they overcharged me. So I moved from a condo with free basic DirecTV that I upgraded with pay channels and a DVR, then went through a local company for internet access (great access from a fly-by-the-night ISP, I clocked them at 70+mbs).I moved to a condo that offered free basic Xfinity (Comcast) TV. So (even after past miserable experiences) to go with the free stuff...who wouldn't! So I got it installed (as described above). I will say that the internet and wireless access has been flawless for two months (color me shocked!). But this DVR is crap! It's slow, laggy, and the controls are counter-intuitive. When something doesn't work as expected and you keep pressing the ""OK"" button (because of the God awful lag), it deletes your program! I'd kill to have my DirecTV DVR back. It worked exactly as you expect. Comcast has obviously cut too many corners on hardware."
"joe of Grand Rapids, MI","Feb. 23, 2015",1,"Had the worse experience that I had with any company or anyone!!! Can't talk to anyone on the phone and when you do it does no good because they DO NOT do anything they say they will. Almost doubled my rate that they (supposedly) signed me up for. You have to take the equipment back to THEM as they say they will not pick it up. They can pick it up out of my dumpster if they want it - I will treat them like they treated me.I'm canceling this lousy, lying, two-faced, sorry excuse for a business and going to Triton. Comcast also lies to you about how many megabytes you need to have to order so as to attempt to drive folks toward the higher priced Mbps and Triton offers 8 Mbps (more than most any company needs) that they guarantee will do me better than Comcast's 105 Mbps @ over a 100 bucks where Triton charges 29.95 per month with a 50.00 one time installation and this is a month to month agreement rather than having to sign up to Comcast for much longer periods of time. SO I SAY COME AND GET YOUR CRAP EQUIPMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE HISTORY TO ME AND I HOPE ANYONE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS RIPOFF COMPANY!!!!!"
"Audrey of Salem, OR","Feb. 8, 2015",1,"When we sign up with Comcast and we had so much problem with the Internet needing rebooted then after our 3rd call they said would send someone out but they were going to charge us or if we needed to sign up and spend another $4.99 a month on a nearly $200 for a monthly service plan. Well we chewed them out and what do you know we haven't had Internet problems since but our cable is bad. Today we went to do a down grade on our cable because we needed to cut expenses, because our rent went up. They said that they were going to charge us a ""cancellation fee""! We told them we are not cancelling just reducing. They said that our contract is for what we have right now and that we can only up-grade but cannot down grade. Well at the end of the school year, our son is home schooled, we are just going to stop paying them. We don't care about our credit because it is already bad because my husband kept losing jobs because of his disability, but now he has his SSD. We are just going to take our laptop to our local library for Internet, get a digital converter for TV, and we have Safe Link for our phone so we will save tons of money once we get rid of this joke of a company."
"Robert of Santa Cruz, CA","Jan. 16, 2015",1,"Comcast sells internet packages claiming they can provide up to 50mb/sec download speeds. Their own technicians have verified that Santa Cruz (where I live) does not have the network infrastructure to provide more than 17/ms download speed, and often less. I have complained to Comcast several times and received an $18 credit on my monthly bill of $120. They have no plans to correct the infrastructure problem. This fraudulent business practice affects thousands of customers in Santa Cruz."
"Stephanie of Richmond, VA","Jan. 6, 2015",1,I called Comcast to fix my internet and phone when they went out a couple of weeks ago. They could not fix it over the phone so they scheduled an appointment to come to the house. The guy fixed the problem when he came but I was blindsided when the bill came and I had a $40.00 service charge. I was not informed before or during the appointment that there was going to be a charge. My cable bill is already close to $200.00 and I barely watch the TV. I called customer service (in the Philippines) and they tried to sell me a service plan on top of the $40.00 service charge!!! They are threatening to charge $350.00 if I cancel the service. Is this legal. I never had to pay for a service charge when I had Verizon. If it goes out again I am just going to be stuck because I do not have $40.00 to pay to have it repaired.
"Gwen of Glen Campbell, PA","Jan. 3, 2015",1,"Comcast has been the only cable provider for this particular geographic area since I moved here in 1999. We had a business and bought business class high speed Internet just because of the stable IP, the speed was really bad.. We consistently had problems and the problem was never in our house. IT was always their lines. Now (2015) I need high speed internet. For years we have been using speedtest.net to calculate our speed since Comcast would NEVER tell us what speed we were buying. No wonder. We have always had a ping of about 50 ms, download speed of 8.48 mbps and upload of 0.78 mbps. Today I spoke with a technician since I am being timed out by the VA, Netflx, Xfinfity downloads, etc. He said it can't be fixed because the lines need to be replaced and Comcast has no interest in doing that. Interestingly, Verizon has customers in the east part of town and they have FIOS. I understand Comcast and Verizon decided to split this area and I am on the wrong side of the division. The tech today actually reduced my monthly fees because the speeds are so bad...he says they don't even offer these speeds anymore. I asked to be upgraded and that wasn't possible because of the lines. Just what should I do now? Dish and Hughs don't work well here either due to the amount of snow we get. I feel like I am not an American citizen anymore. I bet there are places in Africa doing better than this speed."
"Juel of Washington, MI","Jan. 1, 2015",1,"This problem began in October 2014. Comcast ""lost"" my sister's email. When we called about it they said they don't recognize her even though she pays the bill with auto pay. Techs have come out and put in a new modem; said Comcast gave us an outdated modem when we signed up almost a year ago. Our internet is very slow (18) even though she pays for high speed which is supposed to be 105. Now Comcast has turned off the service to her house because of non payment. Comcast took her off of auto pay without any consent and then turned off the service for non payment. We have been trying for four days to get a tech out here. They were supposed to be here between 8:00 and 10:00 am today to re-connect the internet and they have not shown up. It is now 3:15 pm. Another tech was supposed to be here between 2:00 and 4:00 pm. She is on the phone with Comcast right now and they are saying there was never an appointment made. What I want to know is, what do we have to say to Comcast in order to get what is being paid for?"
"Srikanth of Mechanicsburg, PA","Dec. 21, 2014",1,Having Comcast Internet connect in Mechanicsburg is the worst part. I have been escalating to Comcast customer care at least weekly once about my Internet speed. I am paying $53 and I am getting 2 to 5 Mbps speed. Not sure what's wrong with Comcast Internet. I requesting people not to go with Comcast Internet. The worst service.
"Milo of Philadelphia, PA","Dec. 20, 2014",1,"Comcast makes up fraudulent charges on people's bills and has a service system set up to give people a run around, so they never get their bills issues solved. They illegally charge for people's rights to privacy by asking for money when you refuse your Social security number. They lie and say this is for equipment to insure payments but they change the deposit fee to an actual fee on the bill then charge late fees illegally on falsified deposit money requests not received. You can't charge late fees on money that is a deposit, they do so by pretending the deposit is a charge of service by no longer announcing the deposit as such, thus allowing them to claim to not know why you owe the fee and try and get away with such charges. The billing becomes extortion and when you report the fraudulent billing to the FCC they tag on more mystery fees like suddenly they make modem fees appear even though their web site admits you have your own modem and no equipment of theirs. The Billing blames service and service dept. blames billing as a run around ensues. They try every trick imaginable to extort money and make customers have to spend time trying to fix what they refuse to fix. Privacy violations, strong arm tactics, interference of data transmission is some of their tools to get you to drop your FCC charges and consumer complaints (they removed half of my message to the FCC the complaint section was almost all erased). They even try copyright infringement tactics to scare and try and extort more money from their customers. These magically turn up after you file your report to the FCC, but they mess up because they date the incidents on days you can prove not to even be in town with modem or electricity turned on. It's almost as if someone within the organization is sabotaging the company, embezzling money, or attacking the customers, but then I see these tactics have existed for a long time, so I think perhaps this is their everyday known practice since they are too big to prevent from doing whatever they want.Updated on 12/28/2014:I've finally been able to be passed further down the line in this mess Comcast has created. I got one great rep to help remove some of the fraudulent charges, however older ones were still listed on their online bill. I was given a number to call for my dispute with the deposit, but the number said they temp shut my service till I paid the $100 to have it turned back on. (No mention if this was a deposit and since I paid all my bills on time what was owed this = extortion and breech of contract). In fact the number leads to a loops for payment through credit card and even though it says hold for a live rep the same message plays over and over trying to get credit card and payment info.I had a second number to try and resolve this. I had reached what claimed to be an executive support through writing one of the upper customer service managers and they called me a few times giving me a number that wasn't listed as Comcast and that number was just an answering machine each time I called and when leaving a message they never called back. Within this time I received a weird bank phishing email in my Comcast mail acct which nobody has my add for and it had no TO: info filled out, which is necessary in sending a message, so I checked the detail info on sender etc. and it was coming from a Comcast internal email.I plan on handing this info to the Executive support if I ever actually get a hold of them, to trace the ISP number and info along with their internal codes to see if this is an attempt to steal money from people's bank accounts as the work of their own employees or third parties they contract and give our info to. I also have specific details on my last check and letter stating they cannot cash my last check unless they admit I am paid in full and fix their fraudulent charges, therefore if they cash the last check after trying to extort $100 from me and shutting me off then they are literally stealing from my bank account and I will have the clear evidence whether they help decipher the weird bank phishing scam mail or not."
"Cath of San Jose, CA","Dec. 13, 2014",1,"I've been paying my bills online for years, using the same account numbers. I started using the Comcast online pmt system since Dec. 2013. It worked, then suddenly one month, it didn't go through. I called to complain and they removed the $25.00 fee. Well, it happened again in Dec of 2014, and I called telling them I've been using the same account numbers and it didn't go through. So I get the fee charge again. I explained that the account numbers are the same and they pop up automatically when I go to type them in, so how could I put in a wrong number? My bank didn't make a mistake, and I didn't make a mistake. It is THEIR system that made the mistake. They refused to take the charge off and I switched to paper billing. DO NOT USE THE ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEM! IT IS FRAUDULENT!"
"Chris of Pleasanton, CA","Dec. 7, 2014",1,"We signed a new contract to lower our monthly payment, and when the contract kicked in, we lost all our services. Comcast has yet to fix it and when we set up a service appointment for Dec 7th at 8am, our confirmation came back for 2pm. We were told we never had an 8am appointment. No one was able to help us and actually got offended that we were upset. We talked to 5 different people and when transferred, not one person explained the situation to the person we were being transferred to."
"Ahmed of Patterson, CA","Nov. 30, 2014",1,"This has been an on-going issue w/Comcast. Our services in the area of Patterson, CA has been unstable. Regardless as to if you're signed up for 100mbps+ download speed you will get anywhere between 2-20mbps of the actually download speeds provided. There are calls made not just by me, but my neighbors and just about everyone I speak with in Patterson about this issue and nothing is being done to resolve it. They may resolve it one day, but it reoccurs 4-5 times per month and it's very frustrating for paying customers as they're not getting the speeds they should be getting. And practically every night after 8pm until 6-7am, the speeds will always drop to around 2-5mbps. They will send a tech in the morning to take a look at this and of course, every time the tech comes, the issue is gone (makes you wonder). To make matters worse, they've blocked all competition in the area for other ISP providers to compete against their monopoly of the area so you can't just switch service. There's only one service here that offers over 15mbps service and that's unfortunately Comcast. The top rated worst cable provider in based on both BBB and Consumer Affairs and nothing is being done about this monopoly. Them buying Time-Warner will only make matters that much worse for other people across the United States."
"Dale of Ossining, NY","Nov. 15, 2014",1,"I wouldn't even call this a review, more of an injustice. The scam these guys pull is unacceptable. Hidden increased charges, piss poor speeds, poor customer service. You're rated the worst company in America for a reason."
"Paul of Chicago, IL","Nov. 9, 2014",1,"Some friends of mine who are and older couple just moved and decided to order new Comcast service. They asked me to be there the day of the Comcast install because I work in the computer/internet business myself and they wanted me to make sure the computers were connected and working properly on the internet and that their TV service was working properly. They figured a ""second set of eyes"" would also be helpful to assure that the Comcast technician did things correctly, because I told them a few horror stories about awful Comcast installs I had witnessed in the recent past.The technician was scheduled to arrive between 1 and 3 PM. I arrived around 1:30 PM that day (Nov 7th, 2014). We waited and waited...no Comcast guy by 3PM. We called, they said dispatch said he would be about 30 minutes late...3:30 then 4:00 then 4:30 PM..still no show. We called again, took the customer service guy 20 minutes to try and reach dispatch and the technician. Finally he told us that they could reach the original technician scheduled on the job, but that they transferred it to another technician who was on his way and he would be there before 7:00 PM (on a Friday evening). We said okay,..and...and..wait, wait....wait...wait...NO SHOW. Comcast sucks. Period."
"Margaret of Muncie, IN","Nov. 1, 2014",1,"Comcast/xfinity is a nightmare. If anyone can avoid them avoid them like a plague. They are deceptive, lying, manipulative, horrible slap-you-in-the-face business practices. They actually tell reps to lie, to be deceptive. Otherwise they can lose their jobs. Don't work for them. They will only steal the real true person you are and want to be. Only liars work for them. If you are a son or daughter of the great 'decepter' then you belong there.From day 1 they've overcharged me on things. After a year it finally got right then the 1 year promotion is over they charge me double. I upgrade, they do nothing in their promotion right. They start overcharging me again."
"Roger of Ada, MI","Oct. 31, 2014",1,"When Comcast added Xfinity WiFi hotspot, my home network stopped working. I cannot get my gateway to reset so that the home network works. Now all I have is much slower internet connection and not the speed I am paying for."
"Glenn of West Hartford, CT","Oct. 26, 2014",1,"Be careful when responding to direct mail or internet offers to join Comcast Xfinity. I responded to a piece of direct mail offering a 200 dollar visa card and all sorts of perks, including free HBO for two years, etc. Here I am four months into being a customer, no gift card and had to argue to get the HBO and they would only put me on a 6 month offer. They cannot locate my introductory offer stipulations, even though I have the offer right in front of me. Numerous calls to their customer service department proved futile with inexperienced reps ringing their hands, not knowing what to say or how to fix the problem. One thing is for sure, if they don't know what they're offering and seem to be baiting and switching once you join, GET EVERYTHING in writing before you agree to switch from your current cable/internet company..

"Rmm of Alpharetta, GA","Oct. 10, 2014",1,"Comcast is literally the most pathetic excuse of an internet service known to man. I have been paying for 50mbps for years now, and I barely ever get anything more than 5mbps. Often it drops down to 0.3 mbps! I've called many times, and every time I call they tell me I'd have to PAY for a technician to come over. What sort of scam are they running?

I was informed that if i was not happy with the service that i could cancel with no charge or change - THE FOURTH LIE. I changed to what i originally wanted, the 3 MBS and it works fine. I was however charged the full amount of the $55.00 for the first month as the service is suddenly.... prorated. The fifth lie.

"Alex of Venice, FL","Oct. 8, 2014",5,"I have had Comcast for over 5 years now, it would seem ever since I have retired. My wife and I moved from upper New york state and we received terrible internet service where we lived! Always shotty, you would have to cross your fingers and say a little prayer to Mary in hopes that it might work! When we moved down here the folks in our retirement community told us about bundling our package for phone, television, and internet so we did. Now I have no use for the darn phone because I have had my cell phone now for some time and it served me well, but for some reason Verizon just doesn't do too well where I'm at! I don't have any coverage! That's why we got the phone.... Well if I tell you that the service I was provided was anything less than amazing I would be just lying through my teeth!Now sure over the years we've had a couple problems especially after hurricane Charlie and a couple nasty storms causing outages and downed power lines, but it was all fixed shortly there after! One time I called up the customer service just as angry as a gang of honey bees, ready to just quit them, because we were out of all three services for 1 week! They immediately apologized and explained that there were some downed lines which there happened to be, I went and looked myself, and they gave me a 25% discount on my bill for that month! I didn't ask for it, they just offered it to me and it wasn't just a day after my call that, it was back on!I see all these angry responses to Comcast and I might not know everything in my 62 years of life! I've been in war, served in the U.S.M.C., rank of Staff Sergeant was the highest I made it to til my service was over! I will say this that for my area, they do well by me. Maybe the difference is the places we are at but they are stellar in my eye!"

"Jon of Mexico, MS","July 15, 2014",1,"I got my internet speed check and highest it got was 0.02 at 3:00pm - 2:30am and at the middle of the morning I get to 3.00 internet speed, so that mean I cannot go on internet unless I want to stay up all night."
"Bob of Mobile, AL","June 29, 2014",1,"6/21, internet stops working. Call Comcast service line. Talk with someone who apologizes for the inconvenience. Determines that the modem (supplied by Comcast) is not working. Says they can send someone on 6/24. I explain that I work on the Internet and that I cannot be out of touch for that long. Person apologizes again and says they will escalate the trouble ticket and I will hear from someone on 6/22 by noon. Noon on 6/22 comes and goes and I hear from no one. Call Comcast again. Supervisor apologizes again and says the the escalation was denied but that I will hear from someone at Comcast by 10 am on 6/23. 10 am on 6/23 comes and goes, and another call to Comcast and another supervisor apologizes for the inconvenience. This supervisor ""guarantees"" that someone from Comcast will call and that a service person will come to my house by the end of the day on 6/23, but just to make sure, I have an appointment for a service call between 3 and 5 pm on 6/24. You guess it - no call and no service on 6/23, but service tech does come to my house at 4 pm on 6/24 and ""fixes"" the Internet problem. By this time, I have spent more than 2 and a half hours on the telephone with Comcast. Fast forward a few days to 6/27, and internet is out again. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience. Supervisor promises service by midday on 6/28, but, no surprise, no one shows. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience and another promise that someone will call between 10 am and noon on 6/29 to arrange to fix the problem. No one calls or fixes anything and another call to Comcast and another apology for the inconvenience. This time, no promise of quick service (I think by now they figure I have caught on that they can make all the promises they want and I can't do anything if the promise is not kept; so why bother), but there will be a service person here between 8 and 10 am on 7/1. I'll believe it when I see it. It's pretty clear that there is a disconnect between the folks who take your call for service and the people who actually fix things and Comcast just as clearly doesn't seem concerned about that disconnect. Oh, and when I called and asked for a credit for the service that I'm paying for and not getting, then Comcast offered to sell me some additional services. Sounds like a good deal!"
"Craig  of Minnetonka, MN","June 13, 2014",1,"When I attempt to reply to an email the text block fills with hundreds of garbage characters. They cannot be erased. When I hit the reply icon on their toolbar the entire toolbar becomes inoperable and nothing is sent. Their Customer Service does not comprehend the problem. They read through a script that has nothing to do with the issue. They will not let me talk to a supervisor, nor a resident U.S. citizen, nor an email expert. My email has been inoperable for a month. No one there listens or cares or does anything about the problem."
"mike of Saint Paul, MN","June 13, 2014",1,"This is the third time in a month that I've had a negative experience with Comcast. The first time was when I was moving, had an issue, called them twice, sat on hold, got hung up on, and then the same thing happened again the following week. I am now unable to access my email even though I never changed my password and they told me a technician would call me from 5-9 last night, never called, and I have no email."
"Della of Memphis, TN","Dec. 9, 2013",2,"Comcast Internet service suddenly got slow last month. It was perfectly fine until then, and I had no complaints. Now, even photos can take time to download and I have to wait several minutes to watch certain videos. We called customer care and their resolution is for us to pay more money for faster service, plus $250 to install new equipment to accommodate said faster service. Our current bill of $86 will increase to $114."
"Raymond of Memphis, TN","Oct. 16, 2013",1,"I was so dissatisfied with my bill, I contacted customer services. I was cut off several times and when I provided my phone number for a ""call back"", once I answered the phone, another cutoff. After over an hour trying to reach them, I finally got a voice. The person told me they would refer me to Customer Resolution. After I spoke with a guy for less than 2 minutes, he claimed that my telephone number wasn't on file. He then asked for my address and when I provided it to him, he hang up. This was a nightmare of over 2 hours. The next day I went to the COMCAST office, and they told me my problem couldn't be resolved there and only recited my bill again to me. I had enough of their lying and terrible customer services. I am going to cancel COMCAST and end this nightmare with them."
"Ura of New York City, NY","Sept. 27, 2013",1,"Attempted to transfer service from my old address to my new address. I was quoted a price on the phone, wrote the price down, and agreed to the price. Based on the quote, I passed up opportunities for discounted service for satellite service, offered to people moving. First bill comes, and the price is higher than my previous bill (for the same service), and significantly higher than the quoted price. Comcast denies their original price, continually states that their stated price was ""not something they offer"", and says they will need to review the previous call recording and contact me. They fail to do so, and upon contacting them, they will not address the previous call recording, although I suspected it had been reviewed. After multiple calls and several hours I offer to mail their legal department my copy of the original call - which they stated they were recording - and which my cell phone had recorded as well. Suddenly I get something slightly better than the original quoted price and phone service added. Comcast had already confirmed multiple times that there was no way for me to get this offer. I know they sometimes offer a discounted ""triple-play"" price that is less than internet + TV combined - there was no confusion, this offer only came AFTER I stated I had a recording of the original call.In the vast majority of my calls, I was abruptly dumped to collections by employees who did not even collect basic information. Why? The installer hadn't filed the correct paperwork when returning equipment he had collected during installation. I had no idea my account showed a $600+ charge for the equipment, I was just treated like a deadbeat. I only realized THEIR mistake when my second bill arrived, and the equipment charge was listed. I had to wait for that charge to be removed from my account before anyone would even discuss their other mistake in our agreed upon price.Why am I writing this today? Because my service today is intermittently failing. I work for a big networking gear company. Their modem is broken. I know tier 1 support doesn't know that, so I followed their directions politely. I patiently spent time on the phone, again, and now I get to wait two days for a service call. They did ask me to call them back to reduce my bill once the service is corrected. I have no idea why that can't be done without me calling, yet again. They need ME to tell THEM when the service is restored? And not charging for something they're failing to deliver is really the law, not customer service. I wasn't given the option to switch the service to another time. Why would they even worry about whether Sunday was a good day for me? They've already treated me like a deadbeat and a liar, without apology, when the errors have all clearly been on their side."
"Thomas of Heiskell, TN","July 31, 2013",1,"I upgraded to the Xfinity internet with Comcast and have had nothing but trouble with tech support. The techs are just probable just doing their jobs and are polite, but the problem is they want to transfer you to level 2 if level 1 can't fix the problem. They must be from some foreign country as they are hard to understand and don't listen to what you are saying. They ask for the same information over and over. Then they repeat what they said several times and by the time you tell them the problem, they want to know the same thing over again until you become so frustrated you want to throw the phone at them. Well, by the time you get to level 2, they want to charge for the service level 1 couldn't handle. This is not the first time I have had trouble with them. I switched to Comcast several years ago and it took 6 months to get the billing and problems fixed."
"angie of Miami, FL","July 12, 2013",1,We've had so many issues with Comcast. They disconnected our internet service for no reason. They are so incompetent. It’s unfortunate they are such a monopoly.
"George of Spring, TX","June 13, 2013",1,"I chose Comcast/Xfinity to be our DSL and alarm provider, but their actions were not professional from the beginning. We were given a few credits by their corporate office for several no shows, in which one caused us to miss the delivery of important information for our uncle's funeral. The installation person would say that he would be at our house at a certain time, but he did not show up or give a courtesy call. This would jeopardize our work schedule because most of the appointments were on a weekday.Comcast/Xfinity finally installed the equipment, but the billing credits had not been posted and the balance represented the wrong promotional rates. This caused the bill to be incorrect; it continued to be incorrect throughout the months of service. I have made many requests for them to produce a correct bill. Here is a list of problems that I have attempted to resolve with Comcast/Xfinity: This is the message that I receive as I access the Comcast.net portal to check and control things in my house, while out of town: ""Page Error; your account has been suspended. Please contact your service provider to resolve the situation.""My bill has been incorrect since February 2013. Although I have made every attempt to get a bill that shows the correct amount, I continue to see the wrong amount. Internet speed is supposed to have been the fastest, but it seemed sometime slower than my regular AT&T internet speed.Although I had my alarm checked more than once, I still experience the same problems. Four times this past month, I have come home and entered my code to disarm my home alarm. The alarm continues to beep after I have entered the code several times, until the siren finally sound off. Tanisha ** (Executive Customer Relations Houston Region) sent someone out to check this problem. He diagnosed the problem as the code being entered too fast. If I enter the code and one digit does not respond, I will not get another chance to re-enter the code and disarm the alarm. This will eventually lead to the alarm siren sounding. If my alarm constantly triggers, my neighbors will soon ignore it and that leaves opportunity for a real burglary to occur unnoticed. Another problem is the complaints of my alarm going off early in the morning and in our quiet neighborhood; it is disturbing my neighbors. I did not have this problem with my old alarm system!My email system no longer keeps track of when someone enters or leave my house.I could not monitor or control features in my house for weeks all because of reasons mentioned. I made several requests for Mrs. ** to give me the service that I paid for or cancel my contract. Without any attempt to resolve the problems and give adequate service, she immediately canceled my service the same day. I believe this decision was made to avoid giving the credits that were supposed to post to my billing account. I also believe that her decision was an attempt to avoid honoring the very low promotional rate that was offered in the beginning. When I spoke to her the same day that she disconnected my service, she told me that I would not receive a refund for the poor service received the entire time of service. She also made sure to inform me that by taking this matter up with corporate CEO (Brian Roberts), it will only trickle back down to her.I sent Mrs. ** a final email as an attempt to get her to correct the problems. I told her that I'd really rather have this situation resolved and allow them an opportunity to give better service. She told me that my service had already been cancelled and it would cost me installation fees again. She also informed me that the special promotional rates would not be available. This definitely demonstrates how unethical and unscrupulous Comcast/Xfinity is to their customer. To lure a customer in with promotions and not give the service that is expected, but cancel the customer's account instead of attempting to resolve the problems is just ludicrous and immoral.I am requesting that my full service be restored along with the same promotions that were tied to the account; I also need all issues and concerns resolved: I need my bill to reflect the proper amount online moving forward. I need the keypad that does not properly work replaced with one that does work. I need to be able to control and monitor my system online without error. I need your system to do everything that Comcast/Xfinity advertised it to do. I need my high speed internet to reach the speed advertised in the promotion.My house that was monitored under Central Security is unmonitored and can be broken in at any time. If service cannot be restored, I would like a full refund of any amount paid to Comcast/Xfinity!"
"Samantha of Chevy Chase, MD","March 14, 2013",1,"How is it legal that Comcast is allowed to raise my bill by 27% without notifying me and with no improvement in service? Their prices are completely inflated and since they have a monopoly, it pretty much seems they can get away with whatever they want. This is highway robbery. It's actually quite a stupid business model - rather than keeping me as a loyal customer by providing a service at a fair rate, they piss me off and blatantly screw me over with this ridiculousness. Now I'm looking into other options. Everyone I know feels the same way. How do they get away with this?"
"Terri of Richmond, CA","Feb. 19, 2013",2,"Comcast installed (in our home) their Xfinity home phone and internet service in the week of February 4th. They told my husband and I that it would take about five days for our old phone number to port over from T-mobile to them (Comcast). Today is February 19th and we still have not gotten our old phone number ported over yet, but instead we have what Comcast calls a temporary phone number. Because they have not ported over our old home phone number, we cannot retrieve our phone messages from our old phone number. We would like our old phone number ported over as soon as possible."
"Ben of Sycamore, IL","Nov. 24, 2012",1,"We pay $69.95/month for 20 Mbps Internet. We average 2-6 Mbps. We get calls all the time where the salesman from Comcast tells us he's going to send someone out with a cable box and sign us up for cable at the low rate of whatever. And we usually have to hang up on them because they don't take no for an answer. Before signing up with Comcast, be aware of what you're getting into and use someone else if you (unlike us) have the option."
"Ken of Downers Grove, IL","Sept. 2, 2012",1,"There were frequent outages of several hours or more by throttle of bandwidth to almost zero. At an average of once every week, it happens in the 4 pm to 7 pm range. Customer service is clueless and/or blames the modem which I own. I have a great deal of knowledge in telecommunications, having worked in it for many years. It's not the modem - it's Comcast. Upload speeds are not affected, only download speeds. This is intentional and it has to be stopped. I pay for 20Mb/sec and they throttle it down to zero. Not 15, not 12, not 6, but zero. I can receive email only and cannot view YouTube videos or even go to normal websites. It is targeted and punitive against me."
"Scot of Apple Valley, CA","Aug. 31, 2012",1,"My son mailed Comcast’s equipment to Comcast when he canceled his service. The equipment came to our home because this is his mailing address. I spoke to a customer representative and was told to mail (US Postal mail) to Illinois, and the equipment was refused. This is clearly stamped on the box that Comcast refused to accept the return of the equipment. My son is still receiving harassing phone calls about the equipment and money he owes for unpaid service. Comcast clearly is not allowing my son to cancel his service and return his equipment. Consequently, this is now in collections!"
"Angela of Lock Haven, PA","Aug. 18, 2012",1,"I have had Comcast internet for one year, only because it has a monopoly in my area. It's the only internet service I can get besides dial up. We are paying extra for high speed that is rarely high speed. I thought I would save money by getting a home phone through Comcast. It was over $70 to install the phone, which took a total of 2 minutes. After 6 months, they raised my phone bill and I was being charged long distance for my mother's house in the same area code. I called to cancel the phone, and now they said my internet price will go up because I cancelled the phone. I had that price before I got the phone but now it's going up because I'm cancelling? This company is horrible and will screw you any way they can. I hope to God another internet provider comes to our area soon! If you can, avoid using Comcast by all means!"
"Kevin of Maplewood, MN","June 8, 2012",2,"When choosing an internet provider, I liked the Comcast's price and the service. I spoke with a sales rep from the company, Lyn **, and she told me that the transfer process from Century Link would be ""seamless"" and our services will be down for a max. of about 5 min and that we would have to cancel our Century Link Internet (I have e-mail record). The tech came to switch our phone numbers and added cable internet. He looked at our system and said, ""I cannot touch that phone system"" (it is a POPP system). I was baffled because I informed Lyn that we had a POPP phone system. He informed me that we would need to hire a phone tech to work while another Comcast tech came. This cost us an additional $150 and totally wasted my day because I had cleared my afternoon to assist the tech. We had the phone tech come out and the Comcast tech (who was 10 mins late) and set up our phones and internet. All was fine. No problems other than the tech messed with my routers and killed our database for good. We have a domain name and we use the domain for our e-mail. I came to work on Monday after the switch and found out that we were still using Century Link internet servers for our e-mail. I thought, ""Great. I will pay for both services and switch the domain name from Century Link during the weekend when we will have no e-mails going through, thus making the switch seamless."" Well, to my surprise, when I came in to work on Wednesday, Comcast had suspended our services from Century Link (without our permission) and we had no e-mail server/service. I am in the sales business and no e-mail means no orders received. I called Comcast and they said, ""No problem. We will just add your domain to your account."" Great. He walked me through setting up the vanity domain name and then instructed me to go through our host server (**) and have them add our new, **, and target value. The process was supposed to take 24 hours, but could take up to 48. Not so great. After 24 hours, I called the Host to ask if all the information was ""propagated"" and the tech said, ""It should all have been sent sometime last night."" So, he said it is Comcast who was in error. The blame game begins. I call Comcast and they say that it has to be the Host who has not sent the information. After about 7 phone calls and 4 hours, I finally got a manager to talk to at Comcast, Jason out of the Denver office. He said he would call the host company and figure out what is going on and call me back in 2 hours. 2 hours came and went. I angrily went home. Now, it is day 3 (still with no e-mails) and the domain name is still ""provisioning."" I called Comcast and asked to speak to a different manager because Jason lied to me and never called me back (and the host said he never called them either). Now, I deal with the manager whose name is Dustin. He said that Jason had ""escalated"" the ticket to their Tier 2 techs yesterday and it will be 48 hours until I will get a response. I got upset because this issue has already been going on 48 hours and it would appear on my end that they have done nothing. I finally got Dustin to talk to our host (had to make a conference call) and Dustin said he would have his Tier 3 tech call them and figure out what is going on. He said I should receive a response in about 2 hours. I waited 2 and got a call from the Tier 3 tech, Kris (after 48 hours, you would think it would already be at Tier 3). He said it had something to do with Century Link not releasing the domain. He said he would work on it and give me a call back. I then called Century Link and asked if Comcast had called in regards to our account. They informed me that they had no record of receiving a call from Comcast regarding our domain name. Finally, Kris called me at about 3:30 and informed me that the problem was on their end and he didn't know why they would not propagate the domain name. He said he would have to send a message to the manager (I am assuming Dustin) to tell the other techs to ""get their ** in gear, "" basically saying it was Comcast's issue the whole time. So, to sum it all up, 3 days with no e-mail (we figured we lost about $1000 a day at least in orders), my staff who cannot do their job for three days (their job is e-mailing customers and receiving orders via e-mail) thus about another $500 in pay lost, and I made at least 20 phone calls to our host, Century Link and Comcast. When I spoke to Dustin regarding compensation due to the fact that Comcast did not do their job and also told us that the transition would be ""seamless,"" he said simply, ""we don't do that."" I am very unhappy with how the situation was handled by Comcast, how the sales associate lied to us and how the only thing anybody did was finger point on whose problem it was. Also, now I have to work overtime on the weekend to get our e-mail back on track (that is assuming they have fixed it by tomorrow morning). If I were to grade my Comcast experience so far, it would be an F for Fail."
"Teresa of Brighton, MA","May 9, 2012",1,"After seeing a promotion for $150 Visa Gift Card with bundled service, I decided to try Comcast. I was to have my service installed mid-October. The day before installation, I received a call from a rep telling me my installation needed to be rescheduled because there was no service contract on file. Without that, I could not receive my promotion. I was connected to a department where answers to their questions were recorded. It was a verbal agreement to a 2-year contract with them. I was told it would take 3 months to receive my gift card. When March arrived and I had not received my card, I called to inquire about it. I was told someone would get back to me. April came, and I called again. For the second time, I was told someone would get back to me. By the time May 2 came along, I was furious. I called and was told she personally would get back to me, which she did not. I called yet again on the 8th and the man gave me my word he would look further into this and he would personally call me before the day ended. Guess what? It never happened. This morning, I spoke to yet another rep. He put me on hold for a brief period of time and came back to tell me there was no contract on file. I insisted I did indeed have my conversation recorded for a verbal contract. Now he is looking into this, saying that without a contract, I could not qualify for the gift card. He gave me his number and extension and I am to call him in a week if no one gets back to me. I am beyond angry at this point. If they don't keep their word and send me my Visa card, they can take their service and shove it where the sun don't shine. I never had a problem with RCN. I should have stayed with them, but I will definitely be returning to them!"
"Nandasiri of Catonsville , MD","April 25, 2012",1,"On Sunday, January 8, 2012, I spent about 3 hours on the phone trying to resolve a problem regarding our email - i.e. emails sent by one individual are sent back with an error message. Each time I called, the call would go to an outsourced country (Philippines, I believe) and three times I was given the runaround. On the fourth call, I was told by an individual that the call had come to a ""fee-based area"" of Comcast and that I had to pay upfront $49.00! I was shocked by this method of Comcast to collect money for a problem that has originated from Comcast. I vehemently declined to pay a cent. I tried another call, this time asked for the supervisor and the rep said the ""manager has gone home"". I told him call centers don't run without a supervisor. Well, I tried again (6th call) and this time, I asked again for a manager. I was told that the supervisor was on the phone, but he said the supervisor would call me back and asked for my USA number. From past experience, I told him that people in the foreign-located offices never call USA customers to settle a problem. He lied as I have so far not received a call. I am sure if I had spoken to a rep in the USA, this problem would have been resolved. I am frustrated and fed up with Comcast customer service. Who should I contact now?"
"David of Apt 200 i, GA","April 3, 2012",1,"I started service with the GA Comcast service in Lawrenceville. I bought my own modem from Fry's Electronics before starting service with them. All was fine with service, billing - everything at that address. I moved to Cumming, GA and that was when things went bad. First of all, the account rep put on my service order that I needed a modem after telling her several times I owned one. When the tech arrived to set up my service, he saw that I already had a modem and had it properly notated on my account, so I was not charged for it the first month (April 2011) at my current address. I made the mistake of trusting it was off the rest of the time. When my bill went up after 6 months of promo time, I logged in and looked at my bill finding the modem lease fee on my bill. I called and was told they had to escalate it and would take 2-3 weeks to get resolved. After no response for 2 months, I called back in and was told it was not resolved yet. However, it should be soon and I was welcome to stop paying for the modem as it would be credited back to my account. After 3 more months of this, I called in again. This time, I got a competent CSR who made the corrections. However, when they reactivated my service properly, somehow they entered my modem as a rental. I had to take my modem to my local office with proof of purchase to prove it was a retail, not theirs. The ladies at the office were quite helpful and put the proper notation in my account. I was told I had to call back in to corporate to have them correct the billing and listing. I did that, however, the CSR said she didn't have the authority and a supervisor would have to fix it. It got corrected without contacting me. I called back in 2 days later to find this out, but the credit for the nearly year of paying has not been taken care of. I was again told a manager had to do this and would call me within 3 business days. I told them I would register a complaint if no call within that time. Obviously, not taken care of."
"RICHARD of Boca raton, fl","March 25, 2012",1,"Several months ago, unfortunately, I upgraded my Comcast service agreement to include telephone service. Doing so required a different modem and rather than renting the modem from Comcast, I opted to buy a modem. This modem required a Comcast technician to install and the installation was completed. Shortly thereafter, within 30 days, I began to experience internet problems - getting knocked off and/or not being able to log on. Once again, a technician came to my home, tested the entire system and concluded my purchased modem was at fault. A Comcast modem was installed and I returned the purchased modem for a replacement. When that modem arrived, another Comcast technician was called to install.For a short time, everything functioned properly. Then my phone service stopped working on March 19, 2012. I immediately called and reported the problem and was transferred to tech support, who determined that the modem phone function was not working and needed to be replaced. I shared with the technician that I also had no internet service. I was transferred back to customer care. I was told the earliest appointment available was for March 23 between 3:00 and 5:00. I screamed and yelled to no avail. Since I could not receive or make phone calls using Comcast, I provided customer service my cellular number for purposes of confirming the appointment.At 5:30 on March 23, I again contacted Comcast and was told the service technician called and there being no answer, cancelled the appointment. Of course, the call was made to my home phone number, not the cellular number. Again, Comcast was apologetic but could not provide a technician until March 27 between 11:00 and 1:00. But I was assured that someone would call me in an attempt to expedite service. No call was received, so the next day, I re-contacted Comcast and reminded them that my cellular number, not my home phone number, should be used to confirm the appointment. Now I wait to experience another disappointment. Something must be done. A strong message must be delivered to Comcast."
"Larry of Memphis, TN","March 24, 2012",2,"My phone, TV and internet service is so weak that it continually loses it's signal, is totally interrupted and disconnects service.

This is the worst service ever, FCC should decommission them."
"Angie of 188 Lewis St, NM","March 18, 2012",1,"I’m a daughter and I am complaining about Comcast. One thing is that my parents enjoy Comcast and all the features but every time they get the bill, it’s over $600 when it is not even supposed to be that much, near that much. But also, it hurts me because when my mom has it on speaker and my mom says, “Can I pay buy Thursday,” when it’s Monday. Then the reply goes, “Nope, we can’t help you,” and hangs up. That gets me mad so we're canceling Comcast and getting a not so expensive internet and TV because that is ** and is getting way to out of control. So we need lots of people to complain about Comcast to shut the internet and cable down!"

"Chris of Melrose, MA","Feb. 29, 2012",1,"I am writing to let you know of an issue I'm having with Comcast Customer Service. Please bear in mind, I've been a customer for 3 days. Roughly an hour after the install, my service was intermittent and the phone support folks were not able to help and suggested sending someone out to my home. Now, the appointment was scheduled for today (28 Feb 2012) between 6-7 PM. The tech didn't show and claimed I wasn't home. This is demonstrably false, I've been sitting here since 5:30 PM, waiting. No phone call, door bell ring, nothing. This is upsetting to me.I had to leave work early to get home for the appointment and that isn't easy to do. I also depend on the service which, at the moment, isn't working. Not only did the tech lie to his boss, he put me out as well. I expect a higher level of service from you and am very disappointed."
"Bryan of Apt 202, CA","Feb. 23, 2012",1,"I have been trying to access my emails as of late and everything is saying server is not responding, yet I can go into the website and access things there after jumping through hoops to get in. Yesterday as of this date I spoke to a so-called customer service rep and asked why everything was down. I was told they changed security settings and reset everyone's account. I asked if they notified everyone and he said no. No! This is the stuff that makes Comcast service the worst, but unfortunately they are the 800-lb. gorilla on the block and you have no other choice but to go through them or else have no service in my area. And you watch they are still going to charge us for the downtime even though we did not get what we pay for. To date I still cannot get my emails though my mobile phone or have to keep entering my account information on my PC at home every time I want to check it. Unsatisfactory! We don't need attorneys to talk to us, we need somebody to jump down on these thieves and get this stuff corrected now!"
"K of Sunrise, FL","Feb. 22, 2012",1,"I cannot access my Xfinity router to reset the username and password. I have reset it several times according to the manual but I am still receiving an error message. I called Comcast to ask for help. I was informed that if I purchased additional Tech Support services, they would then help me. When I refused to subscribe to additional services to simply get help on how to reset my password and username, I was told to ""feel free to browse the internet for a solution"". This is unacceptable customer service, I'm very disappointed."
"Linwood of Oxon Hill, MD","Feb. 1, 2012",1,"I just moved to the area and ordered cable on November 27, 2011. Here it is three months later and still no cable or internet service to speak of. It has been a living nightmare dealing with Comcast and a complete inconvenience. Starting from day 1 my equipment did not come in a timely manner. After 3-5 days and more than10 phone calls, I finally received my equipment (cable HD box and wireless router); however, I noticed that none of it functioned properly. So once again I had to call Comcast to request another HD box or send a technician to my residence. The first technician never showed up; the second tech didn’t step foot inside my residence; rather, he just went behind my home and said he turned the cable on from there. When I came home that day, I noticed my cable still was not working and neither was my internet! At this point, it was December 14, 2011 and I had become increasingly upset! The third tech was great! He appeared concerned and wanted nothing more than to right the wrong Comcast has committed (that and poor customer service are apparently the only things for which you can provide). He took his time to set everything up: outside working in the back and inside testing out the wire until finally we were on track and my cable and internet worked. Comcast failed yet again as he was never instructed to bring an HD DVR box or a wireless router. He did the best he could, even calling Comcast himself to see what the problem was and order an HD DVR box for me. Again I’d like to point out that tech ** was great! However, he we are. 2 months later, February 1, 2012 and I have not received my HD DVR box or my wireless services.The Department of Homeland Security, by law, is required to tele-work once a week due to traffic regulations in the DC/MD metro-area. However, since Comcast has been insultingly lackadaisical in addressing my issues, I cannot work from home once a week and I don’t have an HD cable box even though you can guarantee my bill shows these services as being provided when they are not! I have been begging and pleading for some sort of assistance since I ordered the service in November 2011. My wife is deployed in Afghanistan and makes every attempt to call when she has time. Though we could web chat via Skype, ooVoo, or web-based video links on my wireless devices if I had internet access that’s compatible with Skype or video services, but I don’t. So most nights I fall asleep in living room waiting for her calls. This is affecting our children as they can’t see her to know she’s alright. Though this is a luxury many don’t have, it’s one I willingly pay for and should be receiving just so that I can bring a sense of normalcy to my children.The customer service at Comcast is beyond deplorable! Check my service records and you will see that I have called repeatedly over the past 2 months and with no results which you can speak of. Absolutely nothing! I am disgusted and offended at the way in which this situation has been handled and am more than ready to file a formal complaint! However, before it gets to that point, I would like to offer you the chance to correct this gross negligence. I am simply looking for consistency so my family and I can enjoy our experience here in the National Capitol Region. I am begging for assistance and apologize for the abrasive tone of this communication, but my patience has run out. I would like to again stress the severity of this situation and look forward to a speedy resolution.Linwood **Washington, DC 20593-7581"
"Monica of Woodstock, GA","Jan. 30, 2012",1,"I was talked into bundling TV, internet, and phone.  The rep never mentioned that long distance and international would have to stay with Comcast and could not use alternate (cheaper) carrier.  2) The internet did not work for 30 days.  Wrong equipment was installed.  I called Comcast and got no help.  Instead, I was told I had to sign up for Infinity Support for $39.99 to find out what the problem was.  I was on the phone up to an hour and transferred all over, and still had no solution.  This company has no customer service.  I cancelled everything and will never do business with them ever again!"
"Lavada of Lakewood, WA","Dec. 30, 2011",3,"The advertising in malls by Comcast on November 7, 2011 said that installation/activation fees were waived.  I called them because of this.  On November 12, a Comcast contractor came, and I got a bill for $129.00, two days later. The service was not working as of November 20, 2011. I called and another Comcast contractor entered my home to connect the phone and internet service. I received another bill for $250, totaling $356, within 10 days. I continued to call and talked to a tech personnel, salesperson, and billing. I repeatedly asked what happened to the free installation/activation and what are the other charges on the bill.  Today, I went into their office off of 6th St. in Tacoma, and with their explanation, I ended up paying the past due amount, before they would even speak to me about downgrading the service. When I tried to downgrade the service, they told me that my bill will be higher than $109 per month.  It would be $130 per month for cable and internet. I had to pay my bill in advance by ten days. I still owe $156.40 plus $160, and I have received 20 days of service up to today. Went I spoke to a tech person, and told him that Comcast placed a virus onto my computer, and I had to pay $130 to a private business to remove the virus.  I am seeking a company or companies to provide internet service, and phone, and cable without killing my budget, and stealing $3.95 unexplained charges as taxes."

"Lauren of North Fort Myers, FL","Dec. 2, 2011",2,"The discounted computer is a scam. You only get so many days to purchase it and they never answer the phone. Comcast transfers you to Dell, who says you can press 1 to leave a message. The problem is, in order to do that you need to know the name of the person you are calling! I have tried unsuccessfully for 5 days in a row to reach them. The first couple days, I called about 20 times throughout the day. The next 3 days, I put my phone on speaker and was on hold between 4 and 7 hours each day before disconnecting."
"Cathy of Hendersonville, tn","Nov. 30, 2011",1,"My computer was not working.  I called Comcast and the man talked me into this program for $98.95 that could do miracles for me and my computer, and have it running like brand new.  After he took my money, he sent me to someone else who could not help me and said, “You’re going to have to call and order the $150 program where they come to your house. I can’t help you.”  I called back in the morning and got a hold of someone who tried to help again and logged into my computer and said nothing was wrong!  I told him it does it off and on.  He didn’t clean up and all the good things I was told from the man who sold it to me.As soon as we got off the phone, I called Comcast that morning and told them to cancel this service.  It was no help to me and I wanted my money back.  I was told no problem.  The computer started doing the same exact things it was doing before he looked at it!  I bought a new computer.  On 11/18, I had Comcast install it.  So, they clearly should have seen it was not fixed!  I called today and this lady Angie only wanted to argue that because he logged in, I could not get my money back.  He was in there around 10 minutes and got out.  The problem was not fixed.  It did the same thing later.  I want my $98.95 back from Comcast for poor representation of their products and for not doing what their seller told me who got me to sign up.  False seller tactics were used to screw people like me over.  Please help me.  I am on disability and I can’t afford to throw my money away like this.  Thank you so much for your help!"

"Terry of Intercession City , FL","Oct. 15, 2011",1,"First off, the Comcast service was never right. It was a shoddy install that I had to complete. The cable boxes only worked part time and I spent the other times on customer service trying to get satisfaction. When the time came to pay the bill, I paid through their automated system by credit card. My service was still interrupted for non payment. My bank says Comcast received the money but Comcast says they never did.At this time the matter has still not been resolved.

"Jorge of Boca Raton, FL","Sept. 6, 2011",1,"Comcast has to be the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. First,  their customer service is on a level to compare it to kindergartener.  Not only do they lie to their customers to their faces but they have inaccurate information at all times, not to mention they fail at doing their own job most of the times, like setting up appointments.Second, their Internet service is a piece of **, since no other words can describe this.  I have had issues with them since Adelphia turned into Comcast and still having issues to this day.  Four to five years now of unstable Internet service.  After calling for months now on a more serious note and escalating this issue to supervisors and managers, no one has yet to return my call or cared to fix this issue. In my opinion, instead of wasting the millions of dollars on advertising false service, fix your current crappy service!"
"Hannah of Manassas, VA","Sept. 6, 2011",1,"We had already agreed for Package X over the phone but in person, she said that it's better to get Package Y.  When I said that I'm not interested in Package Y, she made her voice louder and said that I should listen to what she says first before I talk. I found that to be very, very rude.I agreed to get Package Y (which was Internet + cable), but when the cable guy came, he said that the order did not indicate that we ordered for cable TV and Internet.  He was only prepared for Internet.  Clearly, there was a miscommunication.The cable guy did not receive orders for a router, but we clearly indicated that we want a wireless connection. How can we use Wi-Fi without a router?  Monica ordered for a router.  We asked for the tracking number on Day A.  She was only able to give us the tracking number on Day B.  We tried to track our package but UPS said that they cannot track that particular number.I contacted Monica but she said that was the number that UPS gave.  Instead of helping us get the router (which was supposed to be delivered on August 31), she just gave us the customer service number.The customer service people directed me to three different people before I was finally able to talk to a person. It took them 10 minutes.  The technical service person said that according to their records, UPS could not find our address and that the router was not delivered. I asked for a tracking number and that number was different from what Monica gave us.  We tried tracking it but the package is still not trackable.  The technical service person said that the router could possibly still be in the office but she's not sure.  I should call her again tomorrow.The LAN connection is also unpredictable. Sometimes, we couldn't get a good signal.  It has caused me and my housemates a great deal of inconvenience and we are appalled by the quality of service we are getting from Comcast.We had to share one cable and take turns in using the computer when we are paying for Wi-Fi service.  We need to get in contact with our relatives and friends overseas but we cannot do that at our convenience because of the poor quality of service we are getting."
"Louis of Fort Campbell, KY","Sept. 2, 2011",2,"I live in the barracks and the only provider available is Comcast.

"Tom of Lisbon, CT","Nov. 4, 2010",0,"I'm paying $54.95 per month for Comcast's ""Blast"" cable Internet service, which is supposed to be 16mbps. This was the case until approximately 2 months ago, when the speed suddenly dropped to around 3 to 5 Mbps.I've made several calls to Comcast's tech support for assistance without any success. One tech support person (Stephanie), who obviously didn't know what she was doing, got frustrated and hung up on me. A technician made a house call, but said that my service was as good as everyone else in the area was getting, even though I did several speed tests while he watched, which confirmed my claim of slow connection speeds.I also went to a couple of websites which loaded web pages slowly, but he still claimed that, according to his wi-fi meter, my connection was fine, and there was nothing he could do. After calling tech support several more times, I was told that Comcast couldn't do anything about the problem, and they wished me good luck with it."
"Dustin of Villa Rica, GA","March 29, 2010",0,"What has not happened with this company? The speed advertised is not even close to what you get. When you do get a decent speed it is only burst speed soon to fade away. They complicate any and everything imaginable for a home network. I had to call them to unblock it the day it was set up, amazing. They lied about the free netbook for signing up. I signed up and they say I never signed a contract I never received so I said I will cancel your service then. The verbal contract says I will pay a fee or get submitted to the credit agencies. They have no Quality Assurance Team. The employees are arrogant and my service will probably glitch before I click submit. They definitely let you know customer service isn't needed in every industry! I hate you Comcast!"

So I called up Comcast to request to discontinue phone line with Comcast. Ms. Susan from Comcast said, I had signed a three year contract with Comcast and I just completed one month trial period and a cancellation would result in fee over thousand dollars. Apparently, the exit clause is paying off 70 percent of the future fees to Comcast.Is this one sided contract valid? It is causing significant productivity loss with unwanted phone calls. "
"Rivkah of Sacramento, CA","Feb. 23, 2010",0,"We moved to Sacramento in August 2009 and have had a series of problems with Comcast. First, they promised a ""free netbook"" computer with the package we purchased. After months of phone calls verifying that we would receive the netbook, I called again only to be told that we were no longer eligible because they had not received the appropriate form from us in time. I explained that I had faxed the agreement in early September and in fact had called them in October, November and December asking about the status. While this is a small matter, as a consumer it does not bode well if Comcast is purchasing interest in a television network. I am used to dealing with companies that operate with integrity. Comcast does not care about the consumer!Our most recent adventure is with a problem in service. They sent someone out and verified before the visit that there would be no charge. Upon receiving the bill, we were charged $27.99 for the visit and had to spend 30 minutes dealing with several people to get the charges reversed. I just want our netbook. Ideally, we would be allowed to drop the service and try something else but we have a contract."

"David of Waldorf, MD","Oct. 6, 2009",0,"On Friday, October 2nd, I contacted Comcast on the phone to inquire about upgrading my internet service from my existing speed to the 50 Mb/second service. For those that do not know, this requires a cable modem that is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant. My existing cable modem is not DOCSIS 3.0 compliant, so I knew I needed a new cable modem. I am fully capable of installing equipment and getting line check information. I asked the Comcast representative on the phone what was required, and her initial response was that my service area was not upgraded to 50 Mb/second speeds. I informed her that it was as I knew someone in the area that had the service. She said she had to check and would call back.Five minutes later she called back and confirmed that, indeed, the service was available. She also informed me that it would cost $99/month; it would require renting a modem from Comcast at a monthly fee, and would require a $29.95 installation charge. I told her that I didn't want to pay $29.95 for someone to come in and disconnect my existing modem and hook up a new one as I could do that. She refused to waive the charge, and I told her that would cost Comcast $99/month of lost revenue. Researching on Comcast's website showed that the service fee was either $9.95 or $99.95 to connect to the 50 Mb/second service. I have no idea where the $29.95 fee came from. Later on that same day I made a post on Comcast's forums detailing my phone call experience. George, from Comcast, read the message and responded immediately that he would help.On Saturday, with George's suggestion, I had purchased the required modem and emailed George the MAC address. By Monday morning George had done a line test (remotely), I hooked up the new modem, and George provisioned it (remotely). By 10:30am on Monday I was running at the increased speeds with no installation fee. So, it appears that Comcast does have representatives that go that extra mile to make things right. I can understand the fees for those that are not able to do the installations. However, Comcast should be able to work with their customers to get them the service they want without unnecessary fees when those customers can do without a representative coming to the house."

Also, I got my first bill with $175 additional charges - installation, line install, new connection! I went to their site and emailed them about this. No response. Then I chatted live with a CSR who kept saying, “Sorry, you must understand that if there is an installation, there really are installation charges.” I asked for a manager. She said she couldn't do anything. I asked, “Who could?” She replied that she would submit a credit request and look into this. I asked her when I would hear back. Answer was 48 to 72 hours.

I asked to speak to a supervisor and explained to him that my office is at my home and I was losing business time related to the outage. He was quite rude.

She tried to schedule it for Friday but that was ""already taken"" when she tried. So, the next appointment that would be able to fit my schedule was Tuesday between 5 PM and 8 PM. I did that because my wife and I both work and that was a time I knew we would both be there. The agent came before 3 PM, said nobody was there so the appointment was canceled. I called to complain and was told no appointments for my account were seen but a street service call had been made for my street and he would have tech come to my door. That never happened. I called today to get an update on what the street call discovered. There was nothing there regarding it and the only help I was going to get was to schedule another service call on Friday between 2 PM and 5 PM, which means on my day off, I have to sit in my house and wait for somebody to maybe show up. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told supervisors don't take calls and I would need to leave a message and get a call back. Of course, I was told a supervisor couldn't help. It has been a week now with these issues and no resolutions. My account has poor documentation and service calls I requested aren't showing on it.My Internet service is still spotty. My cable modem, which is five years old and out-dated technology, needs to be replaced and the tech should be doing that along with checking everything from my house out to the road. I am not required to take time out of my day to get a new cable modem and get it set up or take time out of my day to sit and wait for a tech who may not show up.

"Duane of Seattle, WA","Dec. 5, 2008",0,Comcast has been unable to correct a computer issue for months. My online bill pay account access was blocked by them(a fact they refused to accept. I then followed their web page instructions on how to restore it. In doing so I made an error and quickly notified them that I did. I was told it would take 24 hours to fix and it wasn't a major problem. Lie number 1. 72 hours later I still could not get into my account. When I contacted them again they stated it now take 48 hours and be no problem. Which meant they hadn't done anything the first time . Lie number 2. Now the time went from 24 to 48 hours . Lie number 3. Each time I was shuffled around from call center to call center to eventually the chat help. Which is really no help. 72 hours later the problem still was not cured.  I work from online. This time nothing was done. Another lie # 4. Again the phone shuffle. Again the  passing of the buck to the chat line. This time I refused that.Luckily I found an agent willing to talk to me and work with me or so I thought. He acted me and talked to the chat line people. He too was ready to   explode from the incident. He made promises to follow up and call me and have others call me.... more lies. In truth Comcast hadn't worked on it in every incident. I finally had to send letters threatening to sue before things happened. Then to top it all off when they did the work they it twice requiring me to go back and refill the forms twice to get my account activated.  Then today I go to use my computer and my services had been cut off. I then had to waste another morning trying to get some answers. I was told I could not talk to a supervisor when I had talked to one during previous headaches. More lies. The constant lies has left me wondering what can I trust from these people? I'm still waiting to hear back from a supervisor. Not having access to make payments was costing me a fortune. Lost time was losing me a fortune. It  may have lost me a few clients. Not having the ability to meet my schedules due to Comcast's inability to meet customers needs is an atrocity.

"Diane of Loganville, GA","Oct. 7, 2008",0,"For 6 years, I've worked from my home using Comcast Internet service to update and maintain several web sites for my home-based business. Then 3 weeks ago, updating the sites became almost impossible. I could connect easily (using Contribute), but saving a change (just correcting a misspelled word) took anywhere from 5 minutes to 35 minutes. The same thing happened on sites that were hosted on private servers and on a site hosted with Go Daddy and Earthlink.After much research (and talking to technical experts at the server company), the diagnosis was that Comcast was blocking my upload. When I contacted Comcast to report the problem, I was told by the rep that Comcast was monitoring people's usage and blocking usage for those they considered 'businesses'. I was 'urged' to sign up for their Business service (which is ONLY $40 more a month that what I pay now). They did agree to send out a service technician, who ran a new cable to replace the old one we had, but the problem still existed. He, too, told me what Comcast was doing about blocking service and urged me to call their business service department. My business literally has come to a stop. To do any website work, I go to a neighbor's house, use their computer and their Comcast service. Apparently, Comcast hasn't 'monitored' their usage as of yet.

In Early February, I called to cancel my internet account effective FEBRUARY 22, 2008.   Then I got a bill and called, because I had called to cancel, but was being charged.  I moved out of the house on February 22, 2008.  I expained this to the person with whom I spoke.  She told me don't worry.   She said they had recorded the disconnect with the February 22 effective date, but had not yet sent someone to the physical address yet to disconnect the service.  However, my Incorrect billing would be fixed as soon as THEIR TECHNICIANS went to do thier job!  I thought the issue had been resolved.  Appearently not.  Because  TODAY I got a NASTY & AGGRESSIVE voice mail message demanding I call to arrange to disconnect my service as new owners wanted to set-up their internet.  I HAD CANCELLED ALREADY!!  I called a SECOND TIME was told A SECOND TIME it would be addressed.  Instead I got hostility and still am being charged for services cancelled in a home I no longer own!  My decision now is not to use Comcast for either cable or internet here in Seattle.  Hopefully they won't screw with my credit.  However, as I have a bill with a past due (again for services twice cancelled in a home I no longer own) I don't put anything past them! I expect I will bet a hit on my credit report for not paying for service in a home I don't own.  Mostly, the consequence to date is frustration and hours of stress."

Also, I downgraded my cable service with them to basic cable. However, I have been trying to get them to credit back my account for services they are charging me for that I do not have. They have collected their equipment ever since October 2006. They are currently charging me for internet service that I do not have with them. They have charged me for standard cable and refuse to credit me back to September and also insist on charging me to have their technicians come out to change the filters to downgrade the cable service. It is not fair that a consumer should have to pay for an error made on Comcast's behalf. They are forcing me to pay for their lack of communication and failure to update their records."

After 5 calls and more than an hour spent on the phone, including one call with a very rude representative to my wife, we resolved the issue: Comcast has credited our account for nearly $400.   Two days later, our service was disconnected. I spent a half-hour trying to resolve this issue. Later in the evening, a Comcast rep called me to sell me digital phone service to add to our package. The lack of customer service and lack of apology is incredibly disturbing as someone who works in public relations. I am seriously considering switching services."

Well they couldn't see my modem so they have to send someone over to see what is the probem. 1st guy found out that the signal is not strong enough, but did not have the key to get in downstairs. 2nd guy was told that no one would be home before 3:00pm, so he came by at 2:15pm... very smart. 3rd guy I don't even think he spoke any English...but he didn't have any keys either. 4th guy had the key, found out that the cable was bad...but it wasn't his job to run a new cable. 5th guy was running 30 minutes late, that in real life turned out to be 6 hours. than he had no idea what was going on... but no problem someone else will be coming to my house in 30 minutes.

"Eleonor of West Orange, NJ","Jan. 25, 2006",0,Comcast increased their monthly price for internet access from $42 to $57.  that's a 36% increase in price!  And there is definitely no enhancement in the speed of internet access nor the quality of service.
"Don of West Chester, PA","Jan. 19, 2006",0,"I had Adelphia high-speed Internet in Southern CA for 5 years and never had a problem. I just moved to PA and Comcast is the only company with high-speed. Comcast is a terrible company to deal with for service problems! First, it took one month to get the service connected because of a Comcast records problem. Now, I have intermittent service (on 10 minutes and off for 5) and Comcast cannot find the problem. The tech told me today that there are 6 or 7 others in this neighborhood experiencing the same problem! The tech has been out 5 times now, and this Friday will be the sixth. The worst thing is that there is no way to escalate the problem within Comcast! Verizon cannot provide DSL where I live or I would switch in a minute. I am seriously considering going back to dial-up, except I have VoIP at a reasonable cost with AT&T and would hate to give that up. If you have good service with Comcast you are lucky. I have heard nothing but comments on how bad their service is here in PA. Competition is badly needed in this business. I really don't think that Comcast would survive with competition."

After several attempts at installing it, we basically gave up, no longer interested in the service. Admittedly, we were lax about having the service officially shut off. But since we never actually received service, we didn't think that we would be charged for the service. Renee should complain in writing to the Philadelphia city agency that licenses Comcast.  "
"Dann of Los Alamos, NM","Nov. 14, 2016",1,"Had been a customer of Comcast for years. Their service and their technical support were good. I have never been happy with their installations nor with their customer support. I recently moved and I had planned to go with CenturyLink, but they only offer 5Mb in my area. So, I made the mistake of calling Comcast. I didn't trust the installer from the beginning. Some of his lies were obvious, like our old router wouldn't work even though it is the same model of Xfinity that he installed. He insisted that the wall plate had to go in the middle of the wall, both horizontally as well as vertically. He tried drilling through the wall and found solid concrete. Then he tried higher up with the same result. Finally he resorted to tapping the wall and found that it was frame just a few inches higher than where he drilled. The wall plate was put in such that it has an obvious bow. It was so unprofessionally done that I paid to have another real Comcast guy come out (I guess the first one was a contractor). He admitted the job was very shoddy. At least he made an effort to route the cable so that it didn't destroy my house, and made some suggestions, but in the end agreed that the wall plate had to go at least near where it was. He said that Comcast would fix the holes in the wall and would get the cable off the ground where the first guy left it. Next day, Comcast called me and said that I insisted that the wall plate go where the first hole was drilled. More lies. I didn't want it anywhere near there. So, he said, Comcast would, out of the kindness of their hearts, pay for half the repairs. I said that was unacceptable. They said I would have to get an estimate and submit it to them. I think they should just get someone out there and get it fixed, skipping the estimate and the infinite mound of red tape that Comcast Accounting is known for. Tomorrow I am having CenturyLink connected. If I can live with their ""dedicated 5Mb"", I'll pay the $50 penalty for early withdrawal from Comcast, and fix the wall myself. My recommendation: try everyone first before you call to have Comcast come out and destroy your home."
"Lacey of Paulsboro, NJ","Nov. 7, 2016",1,They charge you all this money and they can never tell you what's wrong with your cable. Then they make you wait 2-3 days to get a technician out when you pay for the in-home service. Back to DirecTV I go.

The rep I went through told me I was locked in for 24 months, and I was very animate about this being the case. The first months bill was exactly what I was told. The second month it already went up. I was told, and promised this would not happen. I was lied to!! This company is nothing but used car salesman trying to make a buck and they will rip you off to the full extent of their ability. They will lie right to your face and not even blink!! I am currently researching how to get out of this contract as it was not represented honestly, and is not what I was promised.

"Anthony of Washington, DC","Oct. 17, 2016",1,"Today as usual, another service outage. Can't even watch TV cause it's a puzzle. So tired of Comcast, I call every week because of a problem. I'm looking into even cable because Comcast is do ** monkey balls."
"June of State College, PA","Oct. 14, 2016",1,"3 years ago my grandson was deployed to Iraq and his wife stayed with me at ** Port Matilda, PA 16870. I had Comcast as my TV supplier. I was asked to add a channel for $10.00 a month. At the end I could cancel it and get my bill back to where it should be. WELL after a year I cancelled the channel. BUT they did not reduce the price. I do bill pay through my bank so I had no reason to look at the account. When I called to ask why the bill was so high I was told they told me my price was increased. After a few months I was threatened with disconnect for non-payment. So I checked and it turns out I was being charged with late fees and charges. My bill was over $400.00. I paid it and packed up all my Comcast belongings and took them to the office. Imagine they owed me a $15.00 refund. I live in an apartment that is contracted to Comcast for the tenants. I refuse to use them. I use antenna TV."
"David of Palm Beach Gardens, FL","Oct. 12, 2016",1,"A new COMCAST XFINITY customer as of August 2016, I find COMCAST XFINITY Billing Statements are almost unreadable (the meaning of each line-item). When called (10/11/16), COMCAST Billing could not explain the charges in plain English. Considering the following, I'm totally shocked by the exorbitant first bill of $577 for the initial installation of X1 service first & second month in advance (for 3-way combination of TV / Internet / Telephone services). Late by hours for the initial service installation, their technicians showed up without the required equipment. To get the job done, a Supervisor showed-up late to rush the job and worked well past the agreed upon appointment window. The installation went into the night. Despite the fact I scheduled this first request for new-service in-person at the local COMCAST Store, the initial installation technicians arrived unprepared to install  one XFINITY Wi-Fi Modem, one larger HDMI X1 Box and three small DVI boxes to 4 TVs. Though telephone service was inclusive, the connections needed were not even looked. No follow-up appointment was discussed. It was then discovered service to one of the 4 TVs was intermittent and required the small box be unplugged and reconnected every time the TV was turned on. This then required a second service call that again had to be scheduled in-person at the local COMCAST Store. Multiple attempts to schedule service work-orders over the phone were a source of frustration as appointments were canceled by COMCAST's poorly designed automated systems. Having just received a second bill of $277, I contacted COMCAST XFINITY Billing to ask if there was a mistake. I was told the bill was correct. So, for roughly installation & three-months of service I'm being billed about $284 a month, and I'm not even receiving premium channels (like HBO & MAX). In my opinion COMCAST XFINITY is should be held accountable for price-gauging and extremely poor service. If TV is a luxury I suppose COMCAST XFINITY can do whatever they like. However, if their services are considered a Public Service, like any other Standard Utility Service, it is my personal opinion the United States Federal Authorities, FCC, and Florida State Government, and any other governing or licensing agency oversight should immediately act to fully audit every aspect of COMCAST XFINITY'S business dealings in the State of Florida. I truly wish there was another service option in my area. If I had any other option for service I'd permanently my dealings with COMCAST XFINITY. What a rip-off!!!"
"Patrick of Henning, MN","Sept. 28, 2016",1,"Seasonal Convenience Plan - We are now on our 9th season with Comcast. It has not been a good experience, especially this current Summer. I filled in our leave and return dates in April via the computer. Comcast says they did not receive it from their end. Comcast acknowledges that they can verify that we have not used their services since late April, but they choose not to do so. Their position is that they did not receive the electronic submission from us as to the leave date, and as such billed us for several months after that. We live in Florida in the winter months and have Comcast service there. From about the middle of April until about the middle of November we live in Minnesota. We do not have Comcast service in Minnesota where we live. The dates of our leaving and returning vary less than a week from year to year. When I called it to their attention this past July/August twice they assured me that we will get full credit back to the middle of April. But in both cases they ignored this and did not do as they assured me. The supervisor suggested that the people that I visited with did not know their policy, but she did acknowledge that they had their way of verifying our usage dates, and they have our historical records indicating our usual beginning and ending dates as mentioned above. I offered to show her plenty of verification that we returned to Minnesota in April, but she declined to have that sent to her. We have it set up that Comcast sends the billing to our Discover account. The actual service dates don't fully correspond to our monthly Discover statement, so it isn't easy to know exactly when we receive the service when we look at the Discover statement.I acknowledge that I should have looked into this somewhat sooner than what I did. But, as a long-term customer with Comcast, and the simple fact that there are several ways of proving that we left Florida in April and arrived back in Minnesota later in April, I feel that Comcast is again giving very poor customer service. They are a very big company and sure push their weight around. It is very unfortunate that the FCC has permitted such few service providers, with so little competition. We strongly feel that Comcast should accept some proof from us that we left Florida in April, as we did, and credit us accordingly since then. And their supervisor, that I talked to likewise indicated that they too have a way of showing when we stopped using their services in April, i.e. cable TV, and Internet service. And, why assure us of the full refunds if that is not the case. That is very misleading. If their initial contact people don't know the correct policies, they need to be better trained. They also said each time that someone else would be contacting me. The first time that I called in they assured me the full credit along with a call back within 24 hours. No one called back. I ended calling Comcast at least 4 times. Such runaround, misleading information, and rigid policies only beneficial to ""big"" Comcast, is not good customer service! I feel that they should credit our account accordingly!"
"chuck of Noblesville, IN","Sept. 21, 2016",2,"We switched from DirecTV to Xfinity/Comcast for our TV and internet at our previous address and we couldn't have been more pleased with the decision... until we moved. We were assured that moving was a simple process and that it would be seamless. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We moved from a develop neighborhood into another developed neighborhood (we discovered that many of our neighbors in the new home had Comcast service for many years) but they couldn't ""find our house"". They had to send a guy out to make sure that the house was really there and then determine if it was ""capable"" of Comcast service. This took many days because they never dispatched the technician to go to the neighborhood. Once the house was ""found"" it had to be entered into the system, which again took many days because someone dropped the ball and didn't follow through. All of these items took multiple phone calls, waiting on hold for hours, with customer service reps that were less than helpful. Once we moved in we were without service for 6 days. That's not very seamless. We just recently received our first bill. However, it was inaccurate, so to clarify all of the charges we were forced to call the less than helpful customer service reps who place you on hold, this time over an hour, because they cannot answer your simple billing questions. The moral of this story is Comcast/Xfinity customer service is abysmal. If it wasn't for DirecTV's horrible product, we would switch back in a heartbeat because their customer service above reproach. The only reason I gave a 2 star rating is because the products are wonderful. I'm just not sure if they're wonderful enough to have to deal with their people occasionally."
"RF of Adamstown, MD","Sept. 7, 2016",1,"I visited Xfinity's Office in Frederick MD on three occasion to resolve chronic service issues & Overcharges. Comcast keeps charging us $40 extra every other month!! On two visits with a staff member, we were assured the overcharge was erased. But it still goes on! Payment due dates was changed without notification which put us in the overdue category! Currently, the overcharge is $65! But Each time I attempt to log on to pay I was not blocked! I had to change my passport just about every other pay period. Today, I was blocked again from login on my comcast account! This is more than frustrating for a Senior with serious Health Issues. Last night I had to take ** to avoid A-Fib. Now we are getting calls from credit collectors! Very Abusive too.I am going to visit xfinity's office for the last time today. It sounds like another Class Action Lawsuit is a must. Further, we live in a neighborhood in which Fiber Optics were NOT extended to us like the new development across the street! Yet, comcast Charges us as if we have FIOS service! Fraud. This situation have not been remedied. Our Friends has higher level of service including HBO and they pay $65 month less than we do. This was brought to Comcast attention every service interruption."
"Tom of Eugene, OR","Sept. 5, 2016",1,"Dealing with Comcast is like trying to reason with Nazis: it's a waste of time. They just don't care at all, they lie, they are vindictive, they threaten, they are rude, and they take everything they can from you. Perhaps they treat their customers in such an atrocious way because they enjoy a monopoly and are accountable to nobody. We were with Comcast for six years, paying on time each month, but when we moved and our new town didn't offer Comcast, Comcast hit us with a hefty early termination fee, and the nightmare of having to deal with them began.After battling with Comcast for over a month over how much we owed, which varied from nothing to $235.00, depending on which incompetent and deceptive agent spoke with us, we eventually threw in the towel and gave them $75.00 just to make it stop. Having no service and using semaphore or smoke signals is a much better choice than choosing Comcast. With their dishonesty and cold-blooded attitude, the Third Reich could really have put this company to great use. Stay away from them. They are bad news!"
"Cece of Richmond, VA","Sept. 2, 2016",1,"I recently moved to Richmond and wanted to set up services at my new apartment. Initially I was going to switch to Verizon as at my last place Comcast was the only option so I was forced to stick with it despite my unsatisfactory experience with them, this was especially due to the monthly increasing rates while channel options were decreasing which didn't make sense to me. Finally I had cut off the cable and just kept the internet.Because it took me a while to get the contact information for Verizon at my new apartment I decided to call Comcast anyway just to compare pricing. When I called and explained my situation a lady (who essentially became my rep) said she believed she could help reconcile the situation and even give me a better offer so because of this I decided to stay with Comcast. Also because she gave me exceptional service.She set up an appointment for me for Wednesday 8/31/16 because that was when I was moving in and I didn't want to be in my new apartment without being connected at least to the internet. I also explained that that Friday I was having company so she made sure I got an appointment in the right time frame. Because of this I re-arranged my schedule and even requested to leave work early using my PTO hours so that I could be home when the Comcast technician arrived to connect me. He was meant to show up between 5-7 pm. At 6:50 pm I called Comcast to verify my appointment because I had not seen or heard from anyone. The Comcast Customer Service rep informed me that she had put in another ticket (#**) and that the technician had accepted and confirmed that he would be coming to my apartment next. I even left my phone number for them to call me when they arrived because I didn't want to miss them. At this point it was already after 7 pm. I waited until 10:30 pm and still nothing.The next morning I emailed my rep and she did not respond, so I ended up calling Comcast AGAIN! No one had contacted me still. I explained the situation and everyone basically gave me the runaround saying that I now have to wait until the following Tuesday to get hooked up (that is almost a week after my scheduled appointment which was missed due to no fault of mine). I still have not been contacted by ""my rep"" and I am very irritated by this transaction. I feel like Comcast had no regard for me or my time. I essentially used my PTO for nothing because Comcast never showed up and didn't even bother to contact me. Now I'm more upset because I will have to take time off again next Tuesday to accommodate this. Or I can choose not to move forward Comcast, but if I leave this experience will be unforgivable to me because after enticing me with such a good deal I will have to be inconvenienced by setting up services again with someone else AND pay more after having it set in my mind that this is the deal I was going to get. I still have not decided if I want to keep Comcast but I am very appalled and unimpressed by the service."
"Neel of Canton, MS","Aug. 30, 2016",1,"Comcast has worst service. We have hotels and every month our property has issue with cable, they could not find issue, and top management is worst.

"Kyle of Colorado Springs, CO","Aug. 20, 2016",1,"Comcast is a SELLOUT! Half the time you're speaking with some hee-bob across the seas. After being a customer for over 3 years, I had some things go not my way and had to cancel. They REFUSED to work with me on my final balance, charged me $20/month for 12 months & $30+ in taxes from who knows what that all added to over $280. I agreed to the balance & I asked if I could break the payment up into 2 payments because I did not have all the funds. They responded with, ""You have 20 days to pay the balance or we automatically charge you"". I then asked to speak with a supervisor that told me, since I was cancelling their service, they could not help me. They advised me to pay for a $19.99/month plan + $12 for receiver rental to avoid paying the 275$ lol. What the **? I cancelled my card solely for the point of the matter. They won't get a dime. These people are piss poor in customer service & could care less about anything you have to say unless you have $$ for them. There is NO way to get in contact to someone in the upper echelon, there are no places to submit a complaint of that sort, except on a couple online reviews, nobody directly with Comcast. Only kept referring me to the ''legal department'', such **. When you tell a customer who has paid you EVERY month for 3 years that nobody can help you, this is the final judgement, who the hell are you? What happened to America? What happened to customer service? Where have people moral compass gone? So farewell and ** you to Comcast, every single person I run into with Comcast I will convince them to switch & go somewhere else, nobody wants to be a part of your middle east shenanigans anyways.

"Rob of Littlestown, PA","Aug. 11, 2016",1,"This company is appalling. The representatives lie to customers everyday about billing and services they will receive then charge them something completely different on their next billing cycle (evidence below). If that isn't bad enough, they go a step further and berate their OWN customers. My experience: my fiance and myself sign up for double play, two-year contract, and terminate early. We were moving out of our apartment and in with my family, who already has Xfinity, in order to prepare for some future purchases. Upon talking to a representative I am quoted $84.19 for terminating. No problem, except my bill comes in shortly after at 129.01. We call the billing department to see what the issue is and we are met with hostility and resistance. We are then put on hold and shortly later another rep from billing answers and I have to explain what is going on again with the bill. They are generally rude and when I ask for their name, they REFUSE to give it to me. The conversation ends with her saying quote, ""the bill is the bill and [she] was tired of people trying to to cancel service and not pay their bills."" I was HUNG UP ON. I can state right now, I have paid and would be happy to post every paid statement for their lackluster trash called ""service"". This is how Xfinity handles themselves and it pains me to think I went with them just because most of my family and fiance's family has them. After this experience I will never have anything positive to say and will encourage both families to switch to another service, along with anyone that will listen. I can tolerate the lies, and the shoddy equipment, but I will not be disrespected for asking a question. Do yourself a favor and go with any other service or beat your head with a brick when you get bored. Both are better options than Xfinity."

They are irrefutable FACTS!False advertising, breach of contract, theft, failure to fairly compensate for abhorrent and aggravating lack of services, letting customers wait in a queue for long periods of invaluable time that by now must collectively amount to years of aborted man hours only to then be told by an automated voice for the customer to wait for a return call from a Comcast agent that NEVER is actually made by Comcast.Monopolistic practices, failure to provide hours of operation to the billing department such as AFTER 5pm and on the weekends when it would be convenient for hundreds of thousands to contact Comcast regarding Comcast's business S.N.A.F.U.s, deliberately stopping services before billing questions have been adequately resolved in order to gouge the customer with turning off then service back on fees and fleecing each of us out of still more of our hard earned money so they can maximize their profits and etc, and last and by no means least lots more etc's.Email me with how they have used you and so I can begin filing the lawsuit as soon as I have 100 costumes who are more than justifiably angry ""...as hell and not going to take it anymore!"" Total revenue at Philadelphia-based Comcast (The largest U.S. cable operator and the No. 1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider), whose holdings include CNBC, rose 8.5 percent to $19.25 billion in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations of $18.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. CNBC Wednesday, 3 Feb 2016. RCN in Philadelphia charges $50 a month for 155 mbs Internet speed. No contract required.

"Cheryl of Hingham, MA","July 24, 2016",1,"I wrote a few days ago about the unbelievably poor customer service I have been receiving regarding unwarranted charges to my account. I still have a $496 charge when my costs should have been $109. Everyone admits the problem is on their end, but in over 10 days, no refund. I will continue writing all over the internet until something changes. NO COMPANY should be in business with a 0% customer service satisfaction. BTW, the better customer service number is 800 266 2278. If you call 800XFINITY you get the Philippines. At least I get to speak with someone here in this country and someone who will offer a direct line# when you have problems that have been as outrageously unresolved as I have.Now I have no service and called CS again yesterday. First I was told ""there is NO SUCH THING as SAME DAY SERVICE...."" then I was given a choice of between 8A to 10A or 10A to 12N for today. I chose the latter. I called at 11:40A because we hadn't even received the advance phone call. I was told he updated and said he would be there between 11:30A and 12N. At 12:39, I called again and was told I was RESCHEDULED now between 1P and 3P with expected arrival between 2P and 2:30P....no phone call....RESCHEDULED arrival??? They said they had me down for 8A to 10A, which makes this new time even MORE EGREGIOUS. What's wrong with this company? How do you ever stay in business? I now had to reschedule to TUESDAY because of appointments on Monday. My tenant has been without TV and internet since FRIDAY. Does anyone at this company even care? I have at least 4 ticket numbers that I have taken the time to save. With the other calls I just asked them ""What difference would it make?"" I was told ""none."" If you have a choice, go with Verizon Fios or any other company. "
"Ned of Skokie, IL","July 18, 2016",1,"Comcast had a cheap offer for home internet/phone service years ago & wanting to save money I regrettably signed w/ them. Almost on every single billing statement was an unknown charge which I had to call customer service about which Comcast could not understand what the charge was for exactly. After calling & supposedly resolving the erroneous charges, they would do the exact same thing again the following month. I had to cancel w/ them before the year contract. After much complaining they let me out. Then on top of that they would send special offer junk mail almost every other week which I called about & they said they would stop but of course I still get them. Comcast is garbage, an absolutely horrible company."
"Gautam of Harrison, NJ","July 8, 2016",2,"On 07/05/2016 night I saw smoke coming out of the coaxial cable outlet on the wall. That too when the cable box is NOT powered on and it's not connected to electrical outlet for more than 2 weeks. Coaxial cable outlet at Wall was hot and white cover plate turned yellow. I called 1800-Comcast for Customer Service Support. They DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY. Ms. NICKI told that ""Someone will call you back by 11:30 PM"" but no one called. Comcast did not send any emergency help. Rather than they suggested me to call PSEG whereas its coaxial cable which is burning. PSEG would do nothing since it's a cable issue. Using plier, I pulled cable out of the wall and metal piece is still fixed to wall outlet. The wall near outlet that was hot, started cooling down. Luckily nothing happened after that.During installation, a hole was punctured in the wall to bring the cable from alley to inside the bedroom. Not sure if that is the cause. If cable company is not taking ownership on the coaxial cable issue then who will? There is no electrical outlet close to that coaxial cable point at wall. On 07/06 morning, Ms Nicki called to see if someone called me. But nothing happened after that. I called back but could not get connected with supervisor for escalations. Had fire been caught up Comcast won't have any accountability since there is no proof after fire. All I wanted was a technician expert to come and open the Outlet and see what's going on. Someone has to see within the outlet if there was anything wrong. Then we can decide whose issue it is. When we open the cable outlet and if there is any damage done during the puncturing hole in wall Comcast should take ownership and fix it. But nothing happened next day except me calling and follow up out of my fear/panic mode. It happened second time in past 3 months. Since this cable box is powered off mostly, the issue goes unnoticed. First time the technician to fix the low signal strength issues and cable channel issues. He fixed the cable initially 2-3 months before. On 07/06 one technician comes and he says, ""I cannot fix this but my supervisor will call you."" Still no one called back. Rather than that I am calling and escalating again.On 07/07 during my call to 1800-Comcast, I asked for customer grievance cell or senior management for reporting my issue, but they have nothing to offer. After too much wait and insisting continuously, I was able to speak with Ms. EDONIE **, supervisor. She mentioned that someone will come on Saturday but I was not aware of that even. Then I insisted to get help today. She said she will try to send someone today. No one came. I call every day multiple times, spend easy 30 minutes to 1 hour in calls waiting/talking/escalating. There is no proper protocol that someone can come to house and fix the issue. I spoke with Mr. Bert or Mr. Kevin, I was told someone will come between 7-9 am but no one shows and I keep waiting on 07/08.On 07/08 Mr. Luis calls back in response to my survey after call to find out why I gave low rating on the call response or if services are restored. (No one cares about real issue but survey rating I guess that I got this call back from Comcast). Do you expect that there should be some definition of word EMERGENCY? It makes me terribly frustrated while talking to COMCAST CUSTOMER SERVICE, every time repeat the same story. Very unhappy experience with service since they did not understand the word ""Emergency"" and field/duty Supervisors are really careless as they don't care about this issue going so long."
"robert of Big Pine Key, FL","July 1, 2016",1,"We have had Xfinity Comcast ""service"" for 3 years. Initially it took three visits for correct install, which should have warned us as to what was ahead for us. The recurring problem was suspending the service for the summer. You can't do it online. You must do it in person or by phone, so you have no written proof so naturally they keep charging you. Since I have direct pay I can only check to see if they are still billing you or you check your credit card bill and every year they still bill you until you find out, since after we stop service until two months have gone by. Which in our case is $300 plus they won't issue credit because they say we have no proof we called! They have admitted that we haven't used the internet from the time we ""allegedly"" called but still will not issue credit! They are totally crooked and supply lousy service too, slow internet and very expensive. We cancelled service. I will do without the TV and go to ATT who also suck."
"Michael of Slc, UT","July 1, 2016",1,We have a temporary internet cable that needs to be buried. My wife has scheduled to have them come three times and they have not come and not called to explain why. I called last night to talk to them and finally after being on the call 20 minutes the lady said someone would call me for what I thought was to set up a time for them to come. The guy called today and said someone would be calling in 24-48 hours to set up a time. I told him that's what the lady said. I would be receiving a call for within 24 hours and he said she meant that would just be when someone else would call to set up a time to bury the cable. Pathetic.
"April of Strasburg, CO","June 30, 2016",1,"We recently moved to area that does not have Comcast. I was disappointed to have to disconnect because I've been a loyal cable client for 15 yrs. Today, I called to get my last two months of bills. They would not provide them to me online or via email since I've disconnected. They are suppose to be a top of the line internet and cable provider but cannot send an email with a customer's bill. All I want to do is pay my bill. Instead, I have to drive 35 to 40 min each direction to a service center to get my bill. What if I didn't live in a state that had a service center... crap out of luck. This experience has confirmed that I will NEVER use Comcast again."
"clif of Denver, CO","June 9, 2016",1,"Nothing special here folks. Just another complaint that Comcast sells services, then attempts to raise rates by sending a letter stating you were on a promotion but the promotion is up and prices too, then they won't honor the original prices or terms. The really horrible thing here is that Comcast admits this is a typical business practice (misrepresenting the contract) that they use for their sales. How do they live with themselves? This is just a ""bait and switch"" like you'd expect from some thief on the street with three shells and a folding table. Who in the heck is supposed to be regulating these creeps?"
"Kimberly of Hazlet, NJ","May 8, 2016",1,"I have been a Comcast xFinity customer for 3 years, But I have finally had enough and am switching. Before moving I had been a Optimum customer for years with very few issues and expected similar service from Comcast. Unfortunately this has not been the case. Consistently since we moved in we have problems with all 3 services. About every 6 mos they have sent someone out to ""fix"" the problem. They check all the connections, replace our equipment and it gets no better. Things have gotten so bad that multiple times a day we have no phone or internet for varying lengths of time sometimes a couple minutes, usually longer up to 3 or 4 hours.With the TV at least once a day try to change the channel and all you get is an error message telling you to try again later. Forget trying to watch something on demand there is a connection problem error message more often than not; and when you actually get to watch something don't be surprised if it starts over in the middle and you can't fast forward to get back to where you were. Customer service will promise you anything to get you off the phone, but they don't follow through with promised credits or adjustments. Oh and if your bill says you ordered an on demand movie when no one was home forget a credit, They would rather claim someone broke in and watched a movie than issue a credit."
"Jesus of Sebring, FL","April 21, 2016",1,"On April 8, 2016 at around 5:36 we spoke to a person named Youling (unsure of spelling of names) about the triple play package that we saw is for 129.99 plus tax and we mentioned that it will not be higher than that and she said no. We also let her know that day that we want the same phone number we have with century link transferred over and that we want the channel Baby first tv, and she said no problem and that it will be done. On April 13, 2016 around 9:00 we were supposed to get our installation done and one. They said they came and knocked, did not happen. So we had to call again and we spoke to Lizzy who helped to get a technician over to install. And we spoke with her and verified we were getting our same phone number as well as our channels including what we requested (baby first tv), and she stated Yes we will and that we should not worry and sorry for the inconvenience. April 13, 2016 around 12:00. Now when the technician, David, came and started installing we noticed the house phone number had completely changed to a new one and that we did not have the channel we requested. And we told him to stop the installation and let's get this fixed first before continuing. David calls Comcast regarding the channel baby first tv and he spent quite some time on the phone with them and then said the engineers were working on it. And so then he called them about our home phone number and right then and there we found out that Comcast never did anything about us getting our number transferred over to them.The importance of our home phone number is that All our doctors have that number and already my wife missed an important call about the MRI of her spine. Our family have that home phone number and 2 members of our family (one on each side) have cancer, and friends have that home phone number (which my family did not get to contact my friends for a surprise party they did for my birthday).David said we needed to do a third party verification, which was the first time it was mentioned to us, and we did it with him still here. He told us that it was done and that in three days it should be fixed. Then we went back to the channel and we were told that in 24 hours the problem should be fixed. And so we believed him and he finished and left. Later that day we found out they did not have baby first tv in our area. The technician left the cable on top of the ground in which the cable was cut and we did not have phone, Internet, or cable for a day. And all they did was connect it with a tool and still to this day it is left on top.April 18, 2016 around 8:00 p.m we spoke to a guy named Rolf about our home phone number and why it has not changed to our original and requested number yet. And he said they could not transfer it and that it is century links fault. Notice it has been five days already and they left us without our important calls and never notified us about the issue. Rolf refused to transfer us to his supervisor for a very long time and instead of hanging up and waiting for a call, which most likely would never happen, we stayed on hold until finally we spoke to Terrance (in Michigan) the supervisor. We explained to Terrance our situation about our phone number as well as all the issues we have been having since the 8th and he apologized and was doing his ""best"" to assist us. He said that we should have our number fixed soon, that they already put in the computer to their department that does the transfers and that they will contact us. Even said he would give us a courtesy call the next day to keep us informed of what is going on. Terrance did not call the next day but Rolf did just to say the same thing that it is not fixed. Terrance, going back to the 18th, also tried to help with baby first tv but said it was not in our area and sorry for that, and said if there was a movie channel we want that he would add. But our package was supposed to have all movie channels. He also mentioned that he will not charge us for phone until we finally get our number fixed. On April 19, 2016 we spoke to a lady named Stephanie (in Michigan) about our phone issue and she said we would get it this week. And then she was trying to help us with our package but then we got disconnected. April 21, 2016 we received the bill from Comcast and the bill is way higher than what was advertised and mentioned on the 8th of April. We do not need business with people who take advantage of those who are disabled. We did mention to them that I am a 100% disabled veteran and that my wife is deaf and we have many medical problems and that we needed to be accommodated."
"Robert of Ft Lauderdale, FL","April 8, 2016",1,"I've never experienced such shady practices with a corporation before. I purchased an internet plan online that apparently never existed. I never received a receipt for my order, which is very unprofessional. The customer service is useless in getting anything accomplished and I feel like I have no choice but to stick with this POS company. I'm really at a loss for words at how badly I've been treated."
"felicia of Indianapolis, IN","April 6, 2016",1,"I was a new customer to Comcast for their cable services. Will all begin with I moved to a new address and I had a scheduled appointment to have it transferred the next day after I move. Well, while I was at my old address still moving and cleaning items out of my old address, a Comcast technician showed up and I asked the technician, ""Aren't you at the wrong address?"" And he proceeded to tell me that this is where the new service was set up at. Which sounded kinda awkward knowing that I set an appointment to have the services transferred to my new address and I asked the technician, ""How can you install new services when the services are still on here?"" All I need to have them transfer it to my new address.So the technician called the customer service on his phone and explain to the representative on the phone that there was a mistake made and I need to be corrected. She spoke to me directly on the phone and reschedule my appointment for the next day even though I asked her, ""Since the technician was already here and I'm only two streets from our old address, can he come over to transfer the service that he's already over in the area?"" She told me, ""No."" So I left it at that. The next day my second scheduled appointment the technician again went to my old address which I thought was hilarious because this is what happens at the first appointment so I called Comcast again and they assured me that they will take care of the issue. They're not really sure why that happened a second time so this is day number for no services.New appointment was scheduled and guess what? The same thing happened again. By this time I am like, what is going on with this company? The next attempt they didn't show up for my services again that they said that there was services in my home. What? Then they told me that the services was in someone else's name but it wasn't me, what? I just could not believe that all these things can happen with one company. Of course again has a call to find out what is the issue. Now why there's not a technician 5th time? Well the customer service again said they will send someone else out to install my cable services. By this time, I'm just like this is outrageous all I want is my services up and running. Well on the phone for another hour and clarifying that everything is correct I proceeded to say, ""Okay let's give him another shot here,"" 'cause I really want to go to another company. Well this time he didn't show up again so I spoke to another customer service rep which I thought was really good at trying to get all my questions answered but before they even have my cable service is up she's offered me more products and I was like, ""Excuse me but can I get my cable services on first then ask me if I wanted anything else?"" It was like okay another 2 hours dealing with another customer service rep from Comcast. The next day I come home to more boxes from Comcast boxes I can't even use because my service isn't on. Insane, I know. Well this is now a 7th time. Guess what? Finally there's a technician and he proceeded to install my cable services until he tells me, ""Well now we have to run. Oh my new bill line in your home that's going to be a $30 charge."" Are you serious? After all the stuff I went through with customer service you will turn around and charge me more money on a job you guys suppose to do weeks ago. ""Fine,"" I said. I'll pay for it just please get the service is up and running. Then they were up and running. What's in 1 hour, my cable services went down. The two boxes in my bedroom with both froze up. This is ludicrous! What is that hell going on with this company? So now I have to waste more time call them back which I did and they said they will send someone out in two days. Anyhow if they would credit my bill for $20? What only $20? I've been trying to get this thing up and running for weeks and all you offer me is $20 off my bill. I thought it was $20 if they didn't come or if they're late, so I should have over $100 taken off my bill for the services. Okay by this point I am furious. I contact customer services complaints who Comcast which they reached out to me to try to correct the issue which I was kinda happy to hear because I wasn't getting any feedback about my issues with my cable services and they offered me a whopping $30 off my bill. I thought it was a joke so now in total that's supposed to be $50 off my bill but guess what people I only got $30 off my bill the other $20 I was promised by the other rep didn't happen.Well then my first bill came and guess what is a whopping $228. What I've had my services on for only 17 days and I have a bill of $228. This is too funny and the bills of a partial services I wouldn't have paid $175 within the next week then I have a new bill that came out and new bills $422. What in the world are they charging me for? So I looked at the bill they have me charged for five boxes and I only have 3 and 2 boxes they're charging me $20 a piece. What is going on with Comcast? I have had it I am now cancelling my cable services with them. This has the worse customer service.How can they continue to make the same mistakes over and over then turn around and charge you double of what your services are? I only had 135 channels plus Stars channel paid an additional $15 just for the HBO. These customer service rep should not be in this business. No longer will I deal with bad customer service. I am done dealing with Comcast in there have cited services so I am now putting my business over to DirecTV. What they are offering more channels for $100 less. So goodbye Comcast. Hello DirecTV."
"Artist of Decatur, GA","April 3, 2016",1,"Having only 2 options to choose from in tv and internet service providers is close to a monopoly... Comcast has the worst possible customer service I've ever experienced, and the other company is not far behind. Comcast isn't even interested in meeting minimal customer service... they are just interested in profits! Look carefully at your monthly bills, Comcast sneaks fees and charges, so beware!! What the tv and wireless industries needs are a few companies who care about their reputation as moral, honorable and socially conscious businesses who give a damn. Anyone out there?"
"MD of Miami Gardens, FL","April 2, 2016",1,"I scheduled a service visit because my Comcast internet and phone service is out more than it is working. My house number is clearly displayed and there were two vehicles parked in the front yard. I was waiting and watching for the technician's arrival. The technician arrived at my home - backed into my driveway - and never got out of the vehicle, made no attempt to approach my front door or make contact with anyone in the house. I thought he/she was gathering items and preparing to get out of the vehicle, so I anticipated a knock on the door. After a few minutes I went to the door to check, and the technician began to pull away from the driveway. I ran outside and the technician continued to drive away. I immediately contacted Comcast to advise of this incident. I spoke with someone in a call center in another state who couldn't help me. There was no supervisor to speak with, no recourse except to reschedule another appointment at my inconvenience! I received a voice message from Comcast stating that because I missed the technician I must reschedule. Customer service from Comcast is non-existent!"
"Kate of Nashville, TN","March 28, 2016",1,"After Comcast mistakenly applied my payments to a three year old out of state account, four months later it is still unresolved. Every time I try to resolve with proof of payment from bank I am first routed to a call center in India then routed back to the Nashville region. Then I have to provide several different case #'s which the agent always fails to find until I provide. This company that provides internet service will only accept fax as proof of payment. WTF!!! Who has a fax machine in their home these days!!! AS INI!!!I have even emailed the VP of customer service... Not like he gives a **. No response of course. I just spent 29 minutes on the phone to get a live person. Another five minutes with someone who barely speaks English with a fake English name. Do you think this is by design? Yes of course it is!!! I am setting up a class action lawsuit with my attorneys because to add insult to injury this has impacted my credit for them losing my payments.

"Beth of Aurora, CO","March 17, 2016",1,"When I signed up for the 2 year contract I was told on the phone that my bill would not change for 2 years. That is a lie. After a year, my bill went up by $20.00. I was told that I was getting a discount for the equipment, but that discount was only for one year, not the two years that I was sold. When I asked the Comcast rep over the phone where that information was in writing, it turns out there is nothing in writing that he could provide to me. I plan to write Comcast and have them tell me that in writing."
"Andrea of Houston, TX","March 13, 2016",1,"Houston has 2 internet providers - AT&T and Comcast. Both are horrendous, unreliable, and have terrible customer support. Being forced to choose one over the other makes question if we're really a democracy. I've wasted sooo much time and money trying to get decent, reliable service that if I was getting paid to wrestle with Comcast, I'd be a millionaire."
"Cassie of Arvada, CO","March 13, 2016",1,If you have any choice do not use Comcast. The technician who set up our service was not knowledgeable and the company switched our package to a lower one without our knowledge. The service technician also broke our sound bar and Comcast is doing nothing to fix it or replace it. Overall an awful experience and we plan to cancel service asap.
"Kathleen of Seattle, WA","March 3, 2016",1,We met a Comcast representative at a trade show and agreed to meet with him in the afternoon the next day. He was a no show but did call at 5:30 to say that he was unable to make the tentative appointment. Two days later I received a message from Comcast confirming an appointment for the next day. I did not make the appointment so extended to them the courtesy of canceling in. I was placed on hold twice. Spoke to two representatives and explained that I had not made the appointment I was cancelling. Both made me verify my credentials two different ways and asked me to explain why I was canceling the appointment. At 8:20 pm the same night I received another call verifying my appointment. I think I know why our bills are so high -- too much service.
"Neil of Columbia, MD","March 3, 2016",1,"After many years with Verizon FIOS, I decided to switch over to Comcast because they honestly did offer me more channels for less money than Verizon did. However, it was a terrible mistake. First (this is not actually a big deal, but it does bother me), for some reason Comcast does not offer the same HD movie channels that Verizon does. For the premium channels, only the main channels are offered in HD. This means that HBO is in HD; however HBO2, HBOW, HBO Family, etc are only in SD. Same goes for Showtime, Starz, and all the premium channels. I talked to Comcast about it and he basically tried convincing me that Verizon does not offer those either. I have already switched back to Verizon and I assure you, all the premium channels are offered in HD.Now for my real complaint: After having Comcast for about 3 months, my internet and cable went down one day. I thought ok, no big deal, this happens sometimes. After a day I gave them a call and they sent a technician to come check it out. The technician says the problem is not in our house and there is an issue with the wiring outside in my neighborhood. He said he was not qualified to fix this so said a technician who deals with those issues will come and fix it in a couple hours. So later in the day, I noticed a Comcast truck doing work on my street and assumed they were trying to fix this problem. However, they left eventually without stopping by to check if it worked. It still did not work and now I had no idea what the plan was to fix this. So I called Comcast back. They were like ""Oh that's weird"" and sent a technician again 2 days later (this is my 4th day with no internet or cable).Literally the same exact thing happened. Tech came in the house, said problem was outside. Comcast truck came and left and nothing was solved. Called a third time. Person I spoke with said they promised it would get fixed the next day. They did not show up for another 2 days and the same exact thing happened again. I literally told the workers outside to let me know before they leave so we can check it. Nothing, they just left with nothing solved.Throughout this process, I spoke with several ""Supervisors"" in the customer service as I was getting very angry. One supervisor gave me the number and email of another supervisor that was supposed to help me out. I called this number every day and left a voicemail for about a week and heard no response. I also talked to another supervisor that was going to check on some things and assured me repeatedly that she would call me back later that day at 5 PM to check on things and to help out more. I obviously was skeptical and told her all my concerns because they seemed to never respond or want to help me. She continued to promise that she would call me at 5 and she apologized repeatedly and said she could not control what other agents were doing and was like it won't happen with me.Finally I said ok and anticipated her call. Of course, never got contacted again. After 2.5 weeks of no internet, cable, or any inclination of the problem being solved in the future, I canceled my service and switched back to Verizon. I had always heard rumors about how Comcast customer service is horrible but I never imagined it could be as bad as my experience was."
"Debra of Harrisburg, PA","March 2, 2016",2,"No cost effective options to lower cable prices, less channels. Who really watches the golf station?? Cant' fast forward on most on-demand shows...too many commercials. Too many stupid channels.

"Leigh of Portland, OR","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Comcast knows that it is not a consumers' market, as they now have a near monopoly in our area and can raise fees and basically charge whatever they want. Their customer service is hit or miss. The last time we called with an issue regarding our router not working properly, they did send a replacement router, but then increased our monthly bill. This is after stating very plainly that the new modem/router was not going to increase our monthly bills. Add to that, very long hold times, out of state support operators, and general impression of not really caring about customer experience as long as they get paid. Comcast needs to be broken up and definitely not be allowed to merge with Time Warner. Internet access should be equal to all citizens, not based on ability to pay a very high premium fee."
"Etta of Guilford, IN","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"What customer support? A problem... be prepared to be transferred at least 3-4 times and still most likely not have the issue resolved. They also lie about the bundling package prices. The X1 upgrade.. we were told we MAY get up to 75 mbps. We already had 25 mbps which they said could be average. What kind of ""upgrade"" is that? Then they give you a price, but when you receive the email confirmation, it's not at all what was discussed. Extremely deceptive tactics to lock you in for 2 years at really no discount. The internet goes out all the time. Pay more for less... That's their motto. The popular packages are removed from lower packages and put in higher ones to get you to pay them even more to get the channels you regularly watch. Mediocre. "
"M. of Anyplace, NH","Feb. 24, 2016",3,Most trouble calls are from non-technical people following a script card. The end of the call is always followed up with a sales pitch. Internet speed is slow during the evenings. Selection of programming for the package I have is terrible. But I'm all set with spending any more than I have to. Every 6 months the price goes up $3-5 for the same terrible service. At least 1 local outage per month. Cable certainly isn't what it once was. Give me MediaOne or AT&T Broadband of yesteryear. Comcast is the worst.
"Lacey of Tacoma, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,They have to read from the script to be able to accomplish simple tasks or requests vs doing what needs to be done. We have no other choice of cable. We rarely have any service interruptions or issues with the quality of the product. The prices fluctuate often but continue to rise without incentive to stay with the company until you cancel. We have yet to get any service issues. If there were alternative providers in our area we probably would not be with Comcast.
"Linda of Kissimmee, FL","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"When I call, most times I get someone overseas. That is seriously disturbing. They are very hard to understand and there are too many Americans who need jobs. Great internet service when it works... Very good value. Easy to order on demand as well as changing your services. It seems to be getting better lately. The cost goes up and up till I have to call and ask them to bring the cost down or I will change providers. I Do like that there is no contract."
"Marcia of Richmond, IN","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"The last time I called for help, I was transferred to three different people then disconnected. When I got home, I had no DVR service. Another call, disconnected once then, finally, a nice man helped get service back on. I do not like Comcast service. Every person has a different answer or no answer and transfers you and then there is a disconnect. Very frustrating. We got a new TV because we thought the old one had terrible HD quality. But, come to find out, it was the DVR box that was the problem. The HD part did not work. A new box was installed and the service person did not know how to set up the closed caption feature. He had us using two controllers every time we wanted closed captioning. In the end, we figured it out all by ourselves! Actually, we have had little trouble with reliability. Fingers crossed! The cost is too high, there are too many options. I would like to be able to choose my own channels and have fewer, but ones I watch all the time. Way too many channels and it seems like there is still nothing of value to watch."
"Katherine of East Falmouth, MA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"I have called multiple times for various problems and it's like I never called before. They have no record of my complaint, only that I have called. I have been waiting two weeks for a downed cable in the middle of our road. The fire dept finally had to come and cut the cable for safety reasons. They seem clueless and could care less every time I have called with an issue. They are a ripoff and continues to try and find ways to pork the customer. Such as, raising internet prices for customers who watch Netflix more than cable. They're going to find a way to make more money any way they can. I have never experienced a worse cable company than Comcast. I've called multiple times for this recent downed wire and they tell me each time the customer service representatives didn't put any notes in the system. Are you kidding me??? They suck, and if I had another option for internet, local news, and sports, I would cancel Comcast in a heartbeat."
"Bruce of Colonia, NJ","Feb. 19, 2016",1,"Sadly this company has gone downhill rapidly in the last 5 years, although their rates go higher and higher, as they swallow up more and more of the competition. Over the last two weeks I have done nothing but battle with one idiot after another, that tells you anything and delivers nothing, only to find out when you do finally get a supervisor which is rare, that the employee you spoke with was wrong. Comcast has tried to take a payment out of my account 3 times in a one week period, although the payment was made online days before the due date. When questioned as to why, the answer was ""Once in progress it can't be stopped."" Oh yes it can, if the bank removes their ACH privileges with your account which I did.But that did not solve the problem. As I was never told by anyone that another payment was due 4 days behind the initial one I made online. Instead of calling and explaining, I wake up to be shut off. After 7 phone calls, and being disconnected 4 times I finally reached a supervisor, who went through my entire last 30 days of activity with me, and explained that the last three people I had spoken with about this over the last week gave me the incorrect information and apologized for it. When I asked why these folks were allowed to say what they did and also withhold certain details, and if they would be reprimanded, the subject was quickly changed.It is a merry band of thieves that sticks together and covers each other backs, right or wrong. They seem to only hire lower level people that tell you what they have to or what you want to hear in a prescribed time to get you off the phone, regardless if the information they are giving is right or wrong. And if you raise your voice even one octave you will end up being disconnected or sent back in to the pool to wait for someone else. Do not expect refunds even if you are promised them, they will only credit your account. Even if you are told to fax bank statements over, you are wasting your time. It will not happen. Why they even tell you to do this, if they have no intention of honoring the request is beyond me. But sadly we have no choice here the state of N.J., it is them or satellite which is even less reliable. That no competition is allowed is really baffling and possibly unethical as well."
"catherine of Bloomington, IL","Feb. 10, 2016",1,"In December I contacted Comcast to set up service at my son's new apartment in the city he was going to college. Requested a start date of January 13, 2016. Shortly after my soon moved in his TV and internet service were not working. Odd, thought maybe it was an outage. Called Comcast and I was informed much to my surprise that the services were interrupted because of a past due balance from our first bill starting in December. I found this very disturbing because I did not request the service to begin until January 13, 2016. We had never received a bill and another tenant was living there until the last day of December 2015. This made me wonder why Comcast would bill 2 different accounts for the same address, for the same time period and why would a service be interrupted without a bill being sent. This I found all very strange. I called Comcast and after being disconnected and transferred 5 times, Kelli a supervisor in the billing department said she saw the problem and would get the bill corrected and issue a new bill. Not long after speaking with Comcast I received another call from the Comcast collections department. They were calling because I had a past due balance and the services were going to be t/off again. Spoke to another billing supervisor Patricia and she assured me that the services were not going to be interrupted and we should see a new bill soon. I asked Patricia what I should do if the service was t/off again. Patricia informed me that was not going to happen and that I could call back and speak with her if it did. She also waived the 12 dollar disconnect fee. Why would I have a disconnect fee when the billing error was not my fault? Today 02/10/16 the services have been t/off once again. Patricia was wrong, very, very wrong. Called Comcast again spoke to supervisor Josh. Josh informed me after reviewing the account that the services were off because of the past due balance. I asked Josh how I was to pay a bill I have never received. He stated that it was sent and Comcast could not t/on the service until it was paid. Asked to speak with his supervisor and he put in a request for a callback and stated it would be 24-48 hours before they would call. I asked for his supervisor's supervisor at which time he refused, stated he was putting in call back and that is all that can be done. I find these events very sad for a company the size of Comcast and I plan to change the service to DirecTV. Just wanted to let anyone that would listen know DO NOT USE COMCAST SERVICE FOR TV OR INTERNET."
"Michael of Gainesville, FL","Feb. 4, 2016",1,"My mom is a senior citizen on a fixed income. Her encountered a bill increase. She asked me to contact Comcast to see if they could provide a discounted price. 1st phone call to customer service ended in a disconnection while representative was checking on offers. 2nd phone call resulted in a $10 discount and transfer to a customer loyalty representative to receive an additional discount. Customer loyalty representative spoke with her supervisor who suggested having a sales representative call me back with a new customer offer the same day. The bill is in my dad's name, he passed away 1 1/2 years ago. Nobody called. I called the next day. 1st phone call, disconnected when customer service representative picked up the phone. 2nd phone call, customer service representative referred me to a customer loyalty representative who was not able to provide an additional discount unless my mom took out a two year agreement which would save her an additional $10 a month. Told it was not possible to get a better price by setting up a new account, only additional inconvenience through interior of services. Large waste of time. Have contacted Comcast in the past, numerous disconnects, inconsistent advice from customer service representatives. Repeated bad experiences."
"David of Mchenry, IL","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"And so, yesterday we could not access the On-Demand feature that is part of our tv service. Calling Comcast only got me a robot answer and then I waited... until I finally just hung up. Bottom line: could not watch anything on ""On-Demand"" and was not at all satisfied with this experience, especially since I've had to sit thru at least three complete outages in the past few weeks. Who knows how many more there were? I HATE Comcast!"
"Elsa of Peabody, MA","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"I changed a cable box from one bedroom to another. I called customer service to help reprogram the box. Well what a SURPRISE, they couldn't do it over the phone because they were incompatible. They send a representative over and then charge me a 38$ for coming to program a box! No notice on any fees just a charge. I call customer service. The rep. tries to tell me they changed a wire! Well my ** that happened, no wires changed! The representative basically called me a LIAR when I asked to speak to her manager and flat out refused! There has gotta be something we can do! Any suggestions?"
"Jennifer of Philadelphia, PA","Jan. 24, 2016",1,"I had an appointment scheduled with Comcast to come out and hook up my internet service. The day of the appointment no one called or showed up within the allotted time frame. I called, and they couldn't understand why no one called or showed up so they rescheduled my appointment for a later slot on the same day. The time came and went, still no call/no show. Called again to try and get some answers and was instructed that they could reschedule me for 1 week from then. After refusing and speaking to a supervisor he ensured me someone would be out the next day to take care of everything. Next day appointment time came and went. Called to inquire AGAIN and they said I never had an appointment and rescheduled me for 4 days later. This company is a joke. The woman I spoke to gave me constant attitude as if I was somehow ruining her day for them not showing up. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she proceeded to keep talking and ignore me until I screamed supervisor in her ear. She puts me on hold, comes back on and pretends to be the supervisor!!! I immediately demanded she transfer me to someone else. Still have no internet that I've been paying for and they could absolutely care less."
"Dari of Palm Beach Gardens, FL","Jan. 23, 2016",1,"On 12/5/15 I ordered service, the installer came and could not install (said need stronger signal) and said they would have to come back. Instead of fixing the signal strength and coming back to install, they canceled the order. Re-ordered on 1/15/16 and ordered self-installation and the equipment never came. Called again on 1/22/16 and was told there was no order in the system. Have called 3 times today 1/23/16 and they keep transferring to different people and then I get disconnected. HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO PLACE AN ORDER!!! I have spent at least 5 hours on hold over the past month and missed a whole day of work meeting the installer. Unbelievable!!! Now I know why I have AT&T, but I am trying to save money since my community provides basic cable."
"Cheryl of Westfield, MA","Jan. 19, 2016",1,This was the second time I had to call as they don't change the programming like they say they are going to. I would not even have Comcast but the apartment complex I live in won't let us have DirecTV. 4 more months of living here till our lease is up. Then we will have DirecTV again. Comcast sucks.
"Kaydia of Baltimore, MD","Jan. 13, 2016",1,"This has been the worst experience ever. Every day there is something wrong with the Internet or TV. You cannot have a peaceful day watching TV and be happy. Then when the entire community was out of internet they send an tech to your house but have the nerve of charging you when it's their fault, not to mention every month the bill goes up. I would never recommend this company to anyone and with that said I will go to your competition."
"p. of Los Alamos, NM","Jan. 6, 2016",1,"he said it was all set up and asked for a US100 deposit which I provided with a credit card number. Was given an ID number for new account setup. January 5 AM: A different Comcast rep calls to say why we now had two accounts. When I explained she said the guy last night didn't know what he was doing. (I suspected that, and not just because of his broken English.) After about 20 minutes this rep said we could proceed with the new account as planned but would have to speak to my wife, since the new account would be in her name. January 5 PM: Called Comcast with ID number for new account but he said we first had to return the current equipment we rent from Comcast and then set up an appointment for a technician to come and install new equipment for the new account. Seemed illogical to me--why couldn't a tech come and take the old equipment and install the new? This guy was so off-putting that I hung up and called again to get a different rep. January 5 PM: The rep this time was a native English-speaking young woman who seemed to know what she was doing. She said of course we didn't need to return the old equipment ourselves and she didn't even need to speak to my wife. She gave an order number for a tech to come the following morning between 10:00 and 12:00. January 6 AM: No word from Comcast or a tech so I called Comcast again. This woman rep, in barely understandable English, said there was no order number. After 30 minutes I gave up waiting for her to keep checking and hung up. January 6 AM: Called again and spoke to a native English-speaking woman who was very helpful. Said there was indeed such an order and that a tech should appear between 10:00 and 12:00 AM. She also spoke to my wife and got authorization from my wife to allow me to deal now and in future with any issues with the new account in my wife's name. Again provided credit card info for US100 deposit for the new account. January 6 AM: Tech appeared and set up new equipment and everything went well. He said there are a lot of complaints about the Comcast service provided by phone reps. January 6 AM: Saw the new bill Comcast emailed. It listed services I explicitly declined! My bill now would be about the same as it was with the old account! January 6 AM: Called Comcast about the bill and was told they would have to speak to my wife about it because I was not authorized as an account holder! I'll be calling back this evening when my wife is available. So I've spent about 5 hours just talking to phone reps and getting very angry and stressed over the conflicting information about equipment change, authorization, etc. The ""old"" equipment was working just fine--why did we have to get new modem and TV boxes just because the new account is under a different name? My advice to anyone dealing with Comcast phone reps is to hang up immediately if you reach someone with a foreign accent and keep calling back until you have better luck and reach an actual American with no accent! I would very gladly drop Comcast if there were comparable service in my area."
"Dave of Any, CA","Dec. 19, 2015",1,"When you enter a number into your remote, such as when changing channels, should you have to wait for each number to show up? When you press the button for the previous channel, should you have to wait, sometimes as long as 5 full seconds, for the selection to show up on the screen? Five seconds doesn't seem like a long time until you realize how often you use your remote and that this lag is across the board. Everything you do with the remote has a wait time before it happens on the screen. Don't even ask me about on demand. We pay $160 a month for TV, internet, and home phone, and we get no DVR, more commercials, and we wait in line every time we push a button. BTW, we are locked in for 2 years of this? So upset with the wife for ordering this. A few years back I tried to find out how much Comcast would cost after their introductory price ended. Could not find that info online and they would not tell me when I called. Another time I called to suspend the service for a couple months. When I called back to restore it they had no record of the suspension and I had to pay for the service even though they showed that we did not use it for that time period. Typical monopoly behavior. When our 2 years are up, going to find internet service and try all the other options, Amazon Prime, Sling, etc..."
"Michelle of Attalla, AL","Dec. 18, 2015",1,"I have been forced to use Comcast for my business in two locations only because they are the only internet provider in that area. They are terrible. If you have another option, use it. They took 3 weeks for my first location and 4 weeks for my second location to connect service. They send someone to check to see if the building has cable service available and then a week and a half later, they send another person to see if it has a cable outlet and a week or two later, they bring you the equipment. Really? I don't know about you, but internet access is imperative to my business. They initially closed the work order because their GPS didn't show my address. Come to find out, they had the wrong address. You can't get anyone who can make decisions, to answer their phone and they don't return calls. They have hidden fees which is probably to cover the three people they send out to look at the same thing. I wish I had options. Best of luck!"
"Laurie of Knoxville, TN","Nov. 25, 2015",1,"I disconnected my Comcast Service in Early October. I have a refund of 93.45 due me at this time. I have received 2 bills stating the credit on the account of this amount. I have made 4 or more calls to a Call Center to get information about the refund and when to expect it. I have been told many different things about this with no resolution to this problem. I have been numerous Refund Ticket Reference Numbers with no results. I have emailed complaints and called and no resolution yet. I think our calls are sent to some far away call center where they barely understand what the request is. I am very upset with the service I have received from Comcast. No other choice of service providers here in Knoxville, TN."
"Allene of Philadelphia, PA","Nov. 20, 2015",1,"Comcast billed me for an extra box. I called and got that taken off my bill. They also disconnected the box that I am paying for. I called and four hours and four disconnects later and I am still without service. Not only that, but no one understood what I was saying. I kept saying you disconnected my service by accident and they kept saying we can fix your bill. Huh? For all you Comcast people, go to Comcast.com and send an email to the VP of Customer Service Tom K. Someone from his office gets back to you right away and solves your problem. It's a shame you have to contact Corporate to get issues resolved but at least Corporate is responsible."
"ruben of Linden, NJ","Jan. 15, 2016",1,"Comcast got the system working properly without having to change to HD service. Still the voice remote control issue was never resolved.Original ReviewSo, I had Dish networks for 8 years or so and never had any issues, and Clear as my internet provider. Since Clear was discontinuing service as of November I decided to bundle my TV and internet. After doing a bit of searching for service providers I chose Xfinity. One of the initial features that swayed me was the voice command remote on the X1 platform which I signed up for. Problems started right away! Installer could not get them to work with any of my cable boxes. Said the boxes I got were not compatible. After numerous calls, I got bounced from tech support, to billing, to chats and back and forth until I finally just gave up on the whole deal, so no voice remote for me! So now I have Xfinity for about 2 months, yesterday my service goes down both internet and cable service. Called support, first off I am very well versed with wiring home networks and all electronics. The tech is telling me that my boxes are connected incorrectly. After a grueling ten minutes of convincing her that yes I know what a coaxial cable is and yes I can read where CABLE IN is and HDMI etc. and telling her she has got it wrong, but I followed her directions anyway, and her getting irritated at my apparent complete ignorance to put it lightly, she realizes she is looking at the wrong cable box model. She proceeds to apologize but tells me that the reason nothing is working is because I have HD boxes but have standard service and I would have to fork out another $9 a month to get my cable to work or get a tech out to rewire my service 6 days later. I pointed out that my service was working for two months already and my internet was also not working so it seemed to me to be a bigger issue. So she anyway proceeds to switch me to HD temporarily until they could come out and rewire my boxes. Sure enough that was not the problem, still no cable and no internet. Getting tech in hopefully today. After an hour on the phone and to add insult to injury, she warned me that if there is any repair needed within either 12” or 12', I am not sure what she said, I was already exhausted, I would have to pay for it or get some sort of insurance for roughly $5 a month. Seems to me that all they care about is squeezing money from their customers with no concern for the customer experience. I will not recommend Xfinity support to anyone I know."
"Connie of Fort Myers, FL","Nov. 9, 2015",1,"One star is actually generous for Comcast. Problem began Saturday, November 8 when I woke up and saw that my cable and internet were not working. Tried to fix the problem myself and checked all the wires. Started the box again and nothing. Following is a timeline of the horrific service I received.Saturday, November 8th: 8:22 am, First call into Comcast. Was told to check all the wires etc. and nothing. Rep told me that Comcast technicians don't work on the weekend unless it's an emergency and the earliest appointment would be Monday! I asked her isn't Internet and cable not working an emergency? I was told no. I was told by the customer service rep to use my cell phones’ personal hotspot all weekend to gain access to Internet. I hung up. 9:36 am, called Comcast to see if I could at least get my cable working. Comcast rep tried and the cable box was not responding. Was told to go to a Comcast office and switch out my cable box. Nearest Comcast office is 35 minutes away. Loaded the kids and replaced my cable box.Sunday, November 9th: Followed the instructions and installed the new cable box. Still not working. 8:50 am, first call into Comcast on Sunday. Rep told me box has to be plugged in ""uninterrupted"" for at least 30 minutes for data to load. Waited an hour. 10:05 am, called Comcast and the rep send signals etc. and box was still not responding. Told me to wait a half hour again because a signal was sent to see if it responds. 10:40 am, called Comcast. Rep said my issue had been escalated and a technician would be out today. All of a sudden techs worked weekends. Rep could not give me a time when the technician would be out to my house but I was to get a call by noon with a time.12:37 pm. No technician, no call. Called Comcast again! Customer service rep hung up. 12:41 pm, called Comcast. Was told a technician would be out today but once again no time. I told the rep that I wanted to watch the Jets-Jaguars game and if I could go to a local restaurant and have the tech call me and I will be home. Was told no. If the tech was done earlier with an appointment in my area, he could come within 5 minutes and if I was not home he would leave. 1:08 pm, called again as the game was on! Entered my number for a call back. This time I noticed on the automated menu that my appointment time from Monday had ""miraculously"" changed to Wednesday. 2:55 pm, no tech. Received call back from Comcast. But we got disconnected. 2:56 pm, received call back from Comcast. Asked Comcast about the technician that was supposed to come out that day and why my appointment had changed. Was told that there was NOTHING in the system that showed my problem had been escalated and that I had changed the appointment from Monday to Wednesday. Explained the situation to the customer service rep and he told me that he was putting me on a ""brief hold"" to check the status of my appointments. 26 minutes 39 seconds later, I hung up. 3:32 pm, called Comcast. I explained the situation to the woman that I was without Internet and cable etc. and immediately asked to speak with a supervisor. Was told the supervisor is very busy. I told the woman I will hold. A few minutes later she comes back on the line and tells me she can see the supervisor and he is on his way to talk to me. After a brief hold she gets back on line and asks me for my account number. I told her I have paperless billing and my account is on my email. She tells me to get my account before a supervisor can talk to me. I told her you understand I am calling because I have no internet so how am I going to get my account? ""A supervisor ain't gonna talk to you unless you got your account!"" I was told. At this point I was in tears. Tears from a cable company. The rude woman tells me to either call billing to get my account number or go to a Starbucks. A freakin' Starbucks. Are you kidding me? I hung up on her.3:49 pm. Called AGAIN. Was told by the customer service rep that I indeed had an appointment for today and she was trying to reach the technician. After several minutes on hold she comes back on the line and says the technician is not picking up the phone and she will call me by 5pm to let me know when he is coming. 5:28 pm, no call, no tech. Called back. 5:46 pm, received a call from Comcast. Rep said a supervisor was supposed to call me and one would be calling between 7 and 8 pm and that he had changed my appointment to first thing Monday. 8:03 pm. No tech, no call from supervisor. So I called back. Customer service rep said my appointment was till for Wednesday and nothing had been changed. At this point I lost it! Customer service rep went in and changed my appointment to Monday between 1 and 3.Monday November 10th: 8:32 am, called the FCC. Was told to call Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Florida since this was a complaint against Comcast. 9:04 am, called Comcast corporate headquarters. Was transferred to a ""corporate complaint specialist"". Went through the timeline with her and the horrible service I received. She took my complaint and said she would send it to the regional office. All of a sudden there was an emergency in corporate and she could not give me the complaint number because of that but I would get a call back. Are you freakin kidding me? Corporate customer complaint specialist! WOW!All I want to know is how much Comcast is paying the agencies and the people that are supposed to represent up and be allowed to have a monopoly in certain regions? Customers have no choice but to put up with their crappy service due to no other option!"
"Allison of Park City, UT","Nov. 8, 2015",1,"I have had issues with one of my boxes since I started with Comcast 4 months ago. I had someone come out and ""fix"" it but that didn't work and again I was left with a non-working box in my bedroom. I called back and was told they were updating the system and it should work fine in an hour. Well, shockingly it wasn't working so I had to call back and make ANOTHER appointment for someone to come out and fix it. The technician came out and messed with a bunch of wires on the side and back of the house and I told him that there were 3 other apartments in the house to be careful because they all had cable. He told me he fixed it and went on his merry way. A few hours later I get a call from the tenant above me telling me that they now had no cable or internet. I called back and was told that I would have to make an appointment for a technician to come out and fix it and that wouldn't be for another 3 days. So let me get this straight, your technician messes up the lines and now we have to be inconvenienced? I asked to speak with a supervisor as I was getting nowhere with the call center. I was told they have no way to get in contact with their technicians (which I find ridiculous) and then I was told because it was not my apartment they couldn't prove it was the technician who messed it up. SERIOUSLY??? So it's a coincidence that the technician came out that morning and then all of a sudden the cable and internet is out upstairs? The supervisor would not budge. I then tried the online support, nope. NOTHING. I literally spoke with the technician for an hour and he did absolutely NOTHING. She did do something, he gave me the number to the Comcast store and the hours which clearly states they are closed on Saturday. Yeah, thanks for that! Then he had the audacity to say that once a technician came out he was 100% sure that I would have no more issues. Oh is that right? Then why did they have to come out twice to fix the same problem I have had? I have moved around quite a bit and have many different cable companies and I have to say this company is the WORST. I never write on these pages but I felt a need to vent because their customer service is TERRIBLE!"
"Brittany of Brick, NJ","Oct. 29, 2015",1,Nothing but problems! Very expensive and possibly the worst customer service ever. Nearly every day the box freezes and I have to restart it and miss 10-15 minutes of whatever show I was watching. Avoid if you can!
"Elmer of Palm, PA","Oct. 20, 2015",1,"Was going to watch an Arsenal soccer game on today at 2:45 pm but only game available to me was Bayer vs Roma. When I scrolled thru channels I found the match on a spanish channel. In fact they had a choice of 2 matches both in spanish. I called Comcast to express my concern about game on American channel. Was told oh well, sorry. This means I'm being discriminated against because I'm American but I guess that's where the US is going."
"brett of Waukesha, IL","Oct. 15, 2015",1,"Comcast simply lies and uses unfair practices to scam you out of more money. They outsource their customer service to Manila, Philippines and beyond making it difficult to understand and their overseas employees never have consistent practices and are clueless.

"Lauren of Powder Springs , GA","Oct. 14, 2015",1,"We have had our service in our new home for almost a month. We have had internet but not cable, although we are paying for both. I have been on the phone for goes with customer service and not had the problem resolved. Two technicians have come out and not properly set up the cable. They said it was our TV, although before moving we had perfect signal and picture on the TV previous. They changed the cable box and the cable worked for one day then stopped working again. I have had to schedule yet another appointment with a technician to come out. Waste of time and money. Will not be using Comcast again."
"Marcella of Springfield, OR","Oct. 13, 2015",1,"Here is my experience with Comcast that I had last night. 8 months ago we increased our internet speed to 100mbps. This was an additional $15/month. By using Xfinity speed test we found that our service was actually running at 25mbps. We logged on to our account, started an online chat to obtain service and a refund for the speed we did not receive. As you can imagine, they will fight tooth and nail to avoid anything to do with ""refund.""I asked our rep to make sure I could fill out an online survey after our session ended. She said no problem. As I was filling out the survey we noticed a spike in our internet service. 3 computers went offline for a brief moment and then reset. I'm sure you can all guess why that happened. The rep who said ""no problem"" to my request had or has a way of resetting your internet service from their workplace. She knew I was going to leave bad feedback so she reset our service and that ensured that my survey would not be able to be completed. The only way to accomplish it would be to log in again, and that would mean another rep, leaving her with no survey attached to her ID.I have experienced this before but I didn't make the connection until it happened twice. I did get back online and chatted with a supervisor who I asked if she knew about this practice. She gave me the old Comcast ""we strive to serve our customers in the most respectable way yada yada."" You can bet she knew about this practice and if you step back and see a bigger picture here, Comcast themselves must approve, on some level, of this behavior. It is in their best interest to document as much good feedback as possible and avoid/negate the negative feedback. I took a screen shot of this encounter and will be filing/forwarding it to the Oregon State Attorney General and the BBB. If none of us step up with a little leg work to stop this, it will just stay the same."
"Curtis of Washington, DC","Oct. 11, 2015",1,They charged me even though I never had service and then charged me when my service was disconnected twice.
"Celiena of Buchanan , MI","Oct. 10, 2015",1,"My husband and I ordered Comcast because Comcast said they were in our area. Sweet, awesome. The tech gets here 2 days later on time for the appointment. The tech looks right at me and says, ""We can't hook up your internet and TV because you are not in our area."" At first I was like, ""What?"" Then he explained that it's 3 doors down but not at my home. So I looked at him and I said, “I know it's not your fault but cancel it and I don't want to be charged. If we are, we are going to sue for false advertising.” He said we won't be so we will have to see. My advice, go to a retailer and not through online and set everything on paper saying yes they are at your home and go from there."
"Petet of Buffalo Grove , IL","Oct. 10, 2015",1,"Equipments are defected. I have had this issue about 3 to 4 times when picking up equipments. It seems like they package the defected equipment and give it to someone else. Good luck when you have an issue and call the 800 number. You will spend hours and get no results. It has happened to me, my in laws and my brother and sister. It is too bad they have the market. And the only reason I put up with them is because no one else has a faster internet. Their CEO should be ashamed of himself. I would rate them ZERO. It never fails. They keep getting worse."
"vanessa of Cutler Bay, FL","Oct. 5, 2015",1,"I literally cannot begin to describe how horrible my experience and treatment has been with Comcast as a provider. I have not even had them 2 months and to get treated so poorly and no one cares is the worst feeling you could ever have, for thousands of customers feeling this way and getting treated like this is UNFAIR! This is absolutely the worst customer service I've EVER experienced in my life and want to cancel and nothing to do with Comcast from this moment on!!! I called 8 times since 10 am this morning, it is now 2 pm in FL and just got off the phone with the rudest lady in the entire system. My service has been horrific since I joined with Comcast and I want to cancel. It goes in and out, shuts off all the time and getting a hold of someone is the worst experience you could ever have. I will never ever again have Comcast or recommend them to anyone.I am also getting asked to pay a termination fee after having the service for a MONTH and it's being so ** the entire time!!! Is that a joke??? Over $200 because your service all around is horrific? Absolutely NOT! I have received 3 bills and a termination notice all within a month of having them. I have called now 9 times alone just today and no one answers or hangs up on you and then you get someone who talks so bad to you and all I wanted to do by this point is cancel and even when cancelling I have to get mistreated???What kind of company is this that this is ok?? To charge someone over $230 quoted for the worst service in my life is unheard of so much that I wanted to contact the BBB and the news and file as many complaints as I can and I'm 30 years old, just bought a house and have a job, but I have nothing else better to do than complain or stay on hold. I was pretty much in tears so mad with how I've been treated. I am not paying that and want my last bill and to never hear from Comcast again."
"jason of Cambridge, MA","Oct. 4, 2015",1,"We were forced to use Comcast as the apartment building we are in uses those services exclusively. The DVR works 30% of the time, often not recording TV shows we have it set to record and not displaying any on demand shows. This is the biggest waste of money and we will NEVER use this company again."
"frank of Norcross, GA","Oct. 1, 2015",1,"I recently signed up with Comcast for a package of $61.63 special 50 meg internet and TV starter. I was told when I picked up the equipment that the bill will not change. Two months later, my bill is showing $100.00+. I called and went through a stupid automated system. Finally talked to an agent that told me that my billing cycle changed to the 10th of the month instead of the 16th (day that I called for service). She said that she will take charges off but I had to pay upfront and will be credited later. A month after, same thing. I called again and was told that I should pay by the first of every month. I should still pay upfront and will be credited later. The only thing is this time is partial credit and my bill went up from $61.63 to $63.52.I am monitoring this because the same thing happened before with a bill hitting the $200.00 mark by the end of the contract. On one hand you have the cancellation fee if they piss you off, on the other hand you have your credit to worry about. Worse part comes with agent Dante profiling my account thinking that I want to beg for something. Today is the 30th and I am about to make a payment but yet still have to pay more than I was told. A contract is a contract and you cannot go around changing it whenever you feel like it to get more money from people that don't have time to look at their bill and put all their trust in a company like this and get ripped off."
"DONNA of Longboat Key, FL","Sept. 17, 2015",1,"Comcast has the worse customer service out there... I was on the phone for over 2 hours trying to get my billing taken care of. They messed up on my bill and no one would help me. I was disconnected the 1st time. I called back and then the lady hung up on me. Then I called back because I was pissed then the 3rd person I asked to talk to a supervisor and she disconnected me again! At this time I was gonna stay on that phone until I spoke to someone so I called again and ended up talking to a lady who was just nasty to me and disconnected me again. Now I ended up calling back to talk to the last person NUMBER 5 and he sorta resolved my issue but not 100 percent. I swear I can apply for a job at Comcast and my qualifications can be rude, nasty, have no clue on what to do and I would get a job. I canceled Comcast the next day! Guess what? I was able to get through to them in 1 minute when I pushed I wanted to cancel! I told this guy everything and he was trying to get me to stay. I told him that it was NOT his fault but because of horrible customer service I am canceling and this is NOT the first time I have dealt with bad customer service from Comcast. I can't believe they are still in business! I will never ever go back to them even if they gave cable and phone for free!"
"K. of Richmond, CA","Sept. 14, 2015",1,"I closed my Comcast account on June 19, 2015, and was promised a $50.00 refund check, representing the deposit I paid. I received a partial refund check of $34.75 and contacted Comcast on July 17, 2015, to request the remaining deposit amount of $15.25, which Comcast agreed to provide in 2 weeks. When I didn't receive the $15.25 refund check by August 13, 2015, I contacted Comcast and was promised a refund check in 3-4 weeks. When I didn't receive the $15.25 refund check, I contacted Comcast on September 14, 2015. They could not tell me why the refund check had not yet been sent and instructed me to go to my closest Comcast store to pick up my refund check. When I requested my refund at the Comcast store, the representative advised me that the store did not provide refunds. He stated that he did not know why a Comcast representative would send me there.He indicated that he could see a refund request but there was no credit due on the account, so no check would be cut. He proceeded apply a $15.25 credit to the account and explained that this would initiate a refund check that I should receive in 3-4 weeks. I contacted Comcast to complain that I had been given the run around and they promised that I would receive a refund check within one week. I figured I was still just getting the run around so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor apologized for my inconvenience and stated that I would receive a check in 3-4 weeks, not one week. I hope that I will receive the $15.25 refund within the stated timeframe (probably October 5, 2015).But I felt compelled to report Comcast's lack of service, delay in payments, and the inconsistent and misleading statements. I believe that if I owed Comcast money, they would not simply let me apologize and not provide payment. In fact, I would most likely be reported to the credit reporting agencies for lack of payment. But in this case, Comcast owes money to me and has not provided me with the full amount. They have simply offered apologies. I have had my time wasted and have not had use of my funds during this delay. I believe sites like this one allow consumers to report on a company's bad behavior, just as the company would report a consumer's bad payment history to the credit reporting agencies."
"Donna of Sacramento, CA","Sept. 13, 2015",1,"I started with Comcast on a two-year contract. I was not told I would be charged extra after two years. Every pay period it seemed like the bill went from the initial agreed upon 135.00 per month, for everything - internet, phone and HBO, Starz, etc. The service was never right. I was instructed to pick up my own box and connect it or be charged 60.00 for the visit. I spent most of my time arguing on what I wasn't going to pay. The monthly continued to accelerate every month. My final bill was noted at 222.00 where I was told I was being charged 20.00 more dollars for the same package and that Showtime would be going up as well landing me at 235.00 per month. I was also promised a reimbursement of 20.00 due to poor service of which I spent 40 minutes on the phone debating with a supervisor. Comcast IS HORRIBLE! I am paying early termination fees to get far away from them."
"Lindsey of Boynton Bch, FL","Sept. 12, 2015",1,The 2 televisions we use the most seldom work properly. Can't get channels we pay for. Won't even change channels. Sometimes no tv at all. I have spent hours on the phone trying to get help with no results. Usually hung up on and have to start again. Or they say I need a technician to come out but they are unable to schedule now. They will call back but of course never do. Internet is average. Nothing special like they advertise. Need to reboot weekly. I'm finally on the phone with customer retention. They are scheduling for three days from now but want to charge me a fee! A fee to make their system work. The service that I pay for faithfully! Unbelievable.
"Pinaki of Weymouth, MA","Sept. 10, 2015",1,"I have never seen such a horrible service like Xfinity. Wish we have TWC or Verizon in my place. I am sharing some of my experiences below: Last week by mistake I clicked the upgrade modem link. I already have a docsis 3.0 modem, so I called the customer support and asked them to cancel the order. They said they took care of it. After 5 days I got the equipment from Comcast. Now I called them and after 30 minutes service desk told me to return it asap. Now I need to find a center and return it. For last few days, I am seeing tv service has been added to my account. I called customer care and told them I don't need TV service, cancel it. They said TV service not added to my account and no clue why it got added to my account. She said my plan is unchanged but I am not sure if Comcast will charge anything extra. After interacting to Xfinity customer care, it seems some time they are not aware of the things or mislead you."
"Jason of Sarasota , FL","Sept. 8, 2015",1,"I signed up for the ""free trial"" including internet, security, and cable. I was assured that I wouldn't be billed but yet even though I canceled within 30 days I am still being billed. They removed the debt about 7 times but when I call back to check my balance the balance reappears. I've called about 60 or more times and been on hold for probably hundreds of hours."
"dayan of Miami, FL","Sept. 7, 2015",3,"Every month we have the same issue with Comcast. They provide us with a monthly amount and as soon as the bill comes is another amount. We call every month and there's always the same answers that they don't know why, that they will make sure next bill is right but we have to pay what the bill says. Also they all over the phone making offers saying that they will give you a better offer and that you as a consumer won't have to pay more, but when the bill comes the same issue appears."
"Patricia of North Miami Beach, FL","Sept. 7, 2015",1,"I have bundled service with Comcast. All of it has been down since Friday in the early am. I have spent enough hours with Raj, Carlos, and James to start a boy band. It is all of my services, not my equipment so turning the DVR on and off is ludicrous. A technician was suppose to come and check the outside connection today. No one ever showed. The only true appointment they offered is for September 11 - 7 days from the original incident. I could function without TV but I need the internet to conduct my life. They need to FIX IT!"
"ruth of Deerfield, FL","Sept. 1, 2015",1,"I am very, very disappointed with the Comcast service. I tried to pay my bill on the phone automatic service and my cards were declined. Why? I have no idea... In any case I called Comcast at 7:30 pm. It is now 9:45, I'm on hold with my house line... I decided to call with my cell as well. I have 2 phones, one on each ear and I want to scream. I am so upset.... I will hang up and call AT&T!! I give up!!! Very unfair, poor service."
"C. of Cherry Hill, NJ","Aug. 27, 2015",2,"I called two weeks prior to the end of my package deal that I have with Comcast so I could find out what my options were once my package was done in two weeks. I was told I needed to call back the day my package ended because she couldn't tell me anything ""her computer wouldn't allow her to give options"" prior to my package ending. I wanted to set everything up now to start when my package ended so I didn't end up with a very expensive bill. This is another way Comcast tries to rip off the consumer."
"carlene of Conyers, GA","Aug. 27, 2015",1,"Comcast please do a better job at training your representatives. Your reps are usually rude, difficult to communicate with, and not willing to help 100%. Not only poor customer service, but I always get disconnected on the phone and cannot get another rep on the phone in a timely manner."
"Randy of Montgomery Village, MD","Aug. 26, 2015",1,"I have been a Comcast customer ever since I moved to Maryland. I love Comcast. However, I am moving 10 miles up the road and the Comcast does not go up there. We moved in July and I called to have my service transferred. I found out they do not provide service at my new home, and I was told by their representative that I would not be subject to a early termination because they did not provide service there. One month later I get my final bill and now I am being told I have to pay $480 in termination fees. This makes no sense. I was told by their representative I did not have to pay the fee. Why do I have to pay if they don't go up there? In normal situations when this occurs, you have to turn in the equipment and your contract is null and void. Why is Comcast trying to ruin people when we are all trying to survive? What options do I have? I was lied to and this should be punishable somehow!"
"Christine of White Lake, MI","Aug. 21, 2015",1,A big ** to the ** that closed out our service job and NEVER showed. I took 3 hours off work for them to show. ** COMCAST.
"Joshua of Plainfield, IN","Aug. 19, 2015",1,"By far the worst customer service I have ever had. I had a problem with my modem so I called tech support. They came to the conclusion that it needed to be switched out because it was faulty. So we set an appt for the next day at 10:30 to 12:30. We waited and waited and no one ever showed up. I called at 1:00 p.m. and to see what happened and the gentlemen told me that the tech that was supposed to come never did because of a scheduling issue. They didn't even bother to call me to tell me this. I was then disconnected from him when he tried to get me to his supervisor. I was then on the phone from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. talking to different call center employees and when each one tried to connect me to a supervisor they kept disconnecting me and or telling me there was absolutely nothing they could do for me. I was extremely patient up until the very last person I talked to who happened to be a supervisor, because at that point he told me that it was too late and all the technicians were busy, but we could reschedule. Time and time again I told him that I could not reschedule because of work. Long story short, I lost 4 hours at work because of dealing with Comcast. That is money I will not be able to earn back, also I lost work at home that I do on the internet because they didn't fix my modem on the time they said they would. Comcast if you want to make this right, you better contact me ASAP. You cannot set a business appt and not show up for it, and then tell your customer that there is nothing you can do for them when they pay you. If you want to keep my business, you will fix the equipment that I am renting from you, that I am paying you for...."
"maria of Orlando, FL","Aug. 6, 2015",1,"They came on 7/25. Started the installation and wanted me to pay $170 to drop cable wires. Why would we pay for cables to connect their equipment? If I move and need cable dropped at the new resident have to pay for cable wire again. Came back on 8/6. Pulled all my AT&T cables out, dropped their wires and did not finish installing my cable. I am expected to be without cable or internet till 8/13. That is unacceptable. Now I have no AT&T or Comcast. Really unacceptable."
"Derrick of Houston, TX","Aug. 4, 2015",1,"Clerical error much. So this morning I applied for Comcast services online. I got approved. No deposit. I even called live customer service. They broke down my bill told me to go pick up my new equipment. I get to this ghetto terrible Comcast Service Center. They look me up. And guess what, a Deposit pops up. I tell the supervisor he says, ""You got to pay the deposit before we release anything!!"" I am like, ""What just happened in two hours?"" It went from no Deposit to a deposit a few hours later. BS!! I called customer service back and they said, ""Yes it does show a deposit now."" My friend got Comcast - he had 50 dollar deposit. He went to go pay for deposit and get his equipment. Guess what. They were wondering at the service center why he was handing them 50 bucks. He had no deposit at the center."
"sharon of Calumet City, IL","Aug. 3, 2015",1,"Comcast lets anybody come and install cable in your home. They have drilled holes in the middle of my walls in my bedrooms, left the cable wire coiled across the room. It's a safety hazard! It's been 2 weeks and no one is trying to fix the problem. I have taken pictures, made numerous calls, receive ticket numbers, and no one has responded or been back to my apartment. My landlord is livid! HELP!!!"
"Debbie of Broadway, VA","Aug. 2, 2015",1,"I am not the type person to write public complaints and as a matter of fact this is a first for me. The customer service that Comcast has provided over the past 3 weeks was so bad and frustrating to me that I can no longer keep quiet and just go away. For the past 3 weeks I have experienced problems with my On Demand service with Comcast cable. Two cable boxes were replaced, I have made 2 appointment missing work on both occasions. The last appointment no one from Comcast cable came to my house. I have reset my cable box so many times which seems to be Comcast solutions to everything but never works.The guy that came to fix my cable never once walked outside my house to look at what may be a problem outside the house or for that matter never checked inside my house but merely changed cable boxes. I now have to take off from work a third time taking vacation time for something that is not a vacation. I have spend a lot of time talking to people at Comcast that seem clueless on how to resolve this issue. Three weeks to resolve an issue is way too long in my book. I pay more for cable than any other service but get the worse service. I am seriously looking at other options about remaining loyal to Comcast for over 30 years."
"RAYLYN of Tacoma, WA","July 29, 2015",1,"Comcast charged us over 900 for a month of service! We upgraded to the x1 quad package, suppose to be 169.99. It's not... it's 179.99... plus 19.95 for the monitoring, plus a 10 hd fee. Nothing is what they say. We called and asked about the added prices, they conveniently activated the account then charged us over 400 to deactivate us. Plus they put the exact same package on bit over 215, plus charges that were insane! We've had them for over 20 years, it is so crushing to be forced into something now for 2 years and so far every bill is different! Why can't we cancel if they don't uphold their services... I don't get it."
"Denise of Salem, OR","July 27, 2015",1,After the Net neutrality took effect. Comcast has found other ways in ripping you off. I did a new package Feb 2015 and got HBO as part of the package deal for 2 years. For the last 8 years 2 DVR's cost $9.95 and now ($29.85) They took HBO off too. March Bill- $140. April Bill- $128. May-$133. June- $133. July-$186. New Bill $184. WTH?
"Debra of Coconut Creek, FL","July 25, 2015",1,"I've been trying to speak with someone at Comcast for 2 weeks, they charged me the wrong amount, corrected it and then re-set even a larger amount. I've been on hold for 48 mins trying to speak with someone again. They are the worst, not the first time I had this issue. They added someone else's bill to my account because our phone number was similar, how dumb is that for a huge company like this."
"FRANK of West Paducah, KY","July 24, 2015",1,"I have had Comcast for 15 years, for most of this time service has been satisfactory. That is until I received my bill today. They had increased it by $15.00, apparently by adding HBO and renaming my package without my knowledge or consent. Their explanation was that due to their increased costs they had to increase rates in my area, and that in order to make my ""viewing experience"" more enjoyable they added HBO. WHAT A CROCK! With this line of thought I guess they get HBO free. Internet is mainly what I want anyway and there are other alternatives fortunately. For the most part TV sucks, reruns and reality. I find streaming more enjoyable on the TV's apps than cable anyway."
"J of Shelby Township, MI","July 22, 2015",1,"Signed up for 2 services at 2 different locations. One signed up for the $39.99 that included their performance internet of 25Mb and digital converter with Showtime and Streampix for 12 months. At my other location, I signed up for the $49.99 plan with the Plus Blast internet of 75Mb and digital converter with HBO and Streampix. During the online sign up, decided to take another digital converter as it showed $0.00 charge for an additional converter. The next morning I received 2 emails for each sign up, one price was increased from $39.99 to $44.99. The 2nd one, there was an additional charge of $9.95/month for the 2nd digital converter and $10/month for the speed increase (speed that they're offering, there was no increase).This company is a greedy vulture. Even online, when you have screenshots of your orders, they try to screw you. Well, good thing is that I have options for service providers and it was a no brainer to call them immediately and cancel the service orders. You'd think they'd actually try and do business honestly, even when they know people have options. This is exactly why I canceled them last year. Take one service, get a bill for something else. Their customer service is clearly taught to lie to people just like their online services are set up to mislead."
"Katherine C of Jacksonville, FL","July 22, 2015",1,"I went online to sign up for new service with Comcast. I found a plan on the Comcast site and signed up through a chat group with their customer service rep, and installation was not available for a week and a half. Disappointed, but had no choice. Then, I was called a week later by their customer service department, letting me know that the plan I was signed up for was not available in my area and it was canceled, along with my installation date. I then signed up for another plan that cost more money and was given another install date further out. Then, today I received an email reminding me of my installation date that indicated the original date. I called and found out they had me signed up for the wrong plan I agreed to that cost even more money. I'm very frustrated with Comcast. Their customer service reps are idiots. They are supposed to come tomorrow night to install the new service, and I know what I signed up for, but have no idea what I am going to get. The good thing is I did not sign up for a contract. I'm not locked in, so I can cancel at any time. Horrible company to deal!!"
"Mathew of Bellingham, WA","July 21, 2015",1,"I've been a Comcast person my whole life but independently for 20+ years. Yeah they are expensive but it's Comcast and they are West Coast! Well unfortunately... for the 2+ years I've had the Xfinity service. Service has been spotty (and that's being nice). Every time I call them they act like it's the first time I call about issues. I've had multiple technicians out, repairmen out. They've hooked up my TV's non-HD. They've put in boosters, replaced boosters, told me I had to buy internet boosters, ran temp cables, repaired cables. I've been told repairman will be out and they don't show - ""never scheduled.""Then after I call and complain they come out and repair an issue but then say there is still an issue, but that's someone else's job. Then someone else stops by and says they fixed the issue but nothing is fixed. I'm charged for a service that is spotty and does not work like it should.There is never, and I mean never, a Supervisor on shift to talk to. I get the ""We'll put in your request to talk to one and one will call you back. What number would you like them to call you at."" Not one call back from anyone. And I know they are documented because they tell me ""I see you've requested to talk to a Supervisor.""During football season I have 6 TV's in my house, 3 full time. I try to be nice but I've been without phone, cable and Internet, sometimes all at the same time. I have a 3 year old, it's a safety issue not to have phone service! Believe it or not, this is a short review. Feel free to ask details. I unfortunately will most likely be swapping services. :-("
"G of Summit, NJ","July 16, 2015",1,"I switch from Verizon to Comcast trying to save some money and it was a huge mistake. First they offered me a deal of $120.00 for Internet and cable. The first month came up for around $250.00 which they explained it was because the first bill was usually more. The second bill was around the same amount. Then on top of that the Internet never worked and they offered me to pay $12.00 more monthly for a boost to have my service working. My next billed was for $460.00. I called and their answer was that I was a month behind because they charge a month as a deposit. I asked when was my bill going to be what they promised and their answer was that there was no way they would tell me exactly how much my bill would be. Then on top of that he added that ""cable was not a necessity."" That if I wanted to have cable I had to pay my bill. The guy was very disrespectful and basically told they didn't care if I had service with them or not.I paid my bill and for my surprise my next bill was 189.00. I called to disconnect the service and the lady offered me a lower rate if I chose the bundle with the three services. What she didn't explain was that for the $92 she offered me was only for local channels and the regular internet which is very slow. The next day I got an email saying my first bill would be 260.00 because they were charging me installation and a whole bunch of other things. I called and the answer was that I was no longer a new customer so the price she gave was change. This is the biggest scam I've ever heard.I finally made the decision to close my account and guess what the next day they contacted me. I Thought they were calling me to apologize or ask me why I have decided to to cancel my service but the guy was only calling to let me know they calculated the final bill and he wanted to collect payment over the phone. I've never seen a company like this. I don't understand how they get to do business legally by scaling and stealing money. I hope someone can finally do something about to stop them. Please think twice before making this big mistake because you will regret it!"

This is the thing - I was con into a 2 year contract by a fast talking rep who I could not understand because she spoke broken English. I did not sign anything to that effect. I do not need my landline anymore because when I got it, my mom was in hospice home care and it was required. My mom has since passed away and it is no longer needed. I feel as if I was con into a 2 year contract. I am not trying to cancel my other services just the landline.. Comcast use these tactics because they know there is no other option but them. Sad, real sad."
"John of Tyrone, PA","July 13, 2015",1,"At least a 20 minute hold time no matter time of day, with the same music and a constant reminder every 30 seconds that ""your call is important to us."" Spent an hour and a half on the phone to try and sort out why they sent a repo agent to my house (never heard of that before). Transferred 4 times before speaking with someone directly employed by Comcast (they love outsourcing their work to third parties); said one bad thing on twitter and someone from the handle @comcastcares asked me to DM them. When I did, it took 20 minutes in between messages for them to respond and another hour and a half for them to mark my account and take off some erroneous charges. The worst customer service I have ever encountered and not deserving of anyone's money."
"brittany of North Versailles, PA","July 12, 2015",1,"I had just cable $79.99 a month since March 2015 with all channels, they never told me when promotion ended so I was unaware. Got bill in May 2015 stating bill was $199 because promotion ended and wasn't notified. Representative suggested I get all 3 services, cable, phone and internet. Told him I didn't have a need, then he told me it will come out cheaper and have a bill of $107 a month with other fees. Also told me my installation fee was $40 -$49 then I get everything. And after the fact they tell me my installation fee was 107 + all these other bogus fees I was unaware of and my bill is $400. They rip you off, don't tell you anything upfront then give you all these different high bills. That's totally uncalled for. I will also be contacting the BBB as well. Every last technician and representative told me different things."
"alberto of Houston, TX","July 10, 2015",1,"Went to end my service, and the guy acted like he didn't want to do it and was very rude about it. My bill has been going up and up for no reason. I said just cancel, just like that, I didn't want to have a conversation, especially with such a rude person. Then the douche hung up on me like nothing. Customer Service at Comcast has to be the worst."
"L'Oreal of Philadelphia, PA","July 8, 2015",1,"Charged my account one month in advance, then suspend my services after they get almost $200 last month (June). How do I have an overdue balance if I paid over $400 within the last 2 & a half months? COMCAST IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF! NEVER AGAIN!!!"
"dan of Williamstown, NJ","July 8, 2015",2,"I called Comcast 6 months ago and agreed to their package Deal, 89.99 for the triple play; my bill was suppose to be after surcharges and taxes 118.00 every month but from the first day we received our bill it was 160.00, next month jumped to 190, then went down to 177, then jumped to 275, 201, and 245. We calculated our bill with corporate office and had 5 payments of total of 905.00. After figuring out that Comcast owes us a credit of 65.00 and admitted that the reason my bill was so high was because they put in a hd box and have been charging us for the last 6 months their services we didn't have and also for a dvr which we don't have. After all said and done they are saying we owe them 587.00 still and will not turn on my service until we pay a past due of 247.00. When asked to speak to someone higher the lady said there is no one higher and it was pointless for me to try and speak to another higher than her; I then while on the phone with her called the corporate office and asked if I could speak to a higher person and they put in a request for my bills to be looked at properly but would take for another person to call me back 24 to 48 hrs later. I've been on the phone with them for 2 days now trying to get this situation worked out but still now have to wait a extra 48 hrs to get help. I don't work for Comcast. I shouldn't have to sit on a phone and try and fix my bill that they screwed up. My bill should be 0 as of right now they see it. They did the math but refuse to say they overcharged me and was their mistake. If you do the math it doesn't add up. Will update status after I get final results; it's ok to be wrong. Everyone is human. Just fix the problem not looking for a handout or anything extra. I just don't want to be robbed and it seems at this point they think they can do this just put service in and tell you what you're going to get when you didn't ask for it nor ever used it. Comcast we are your customers. Do you even value our business? This is why you lose so many customers. It starts with us and ends with you. Fix the problem Please."
"Zandra of Suite 5G, FL","July 1, 2015",1,"We requested a transfer of business service weeks in advance. Days before our move Comcast cut off all our services (internet, phone and fax lines). We called multiple times and each time we were told that it would be connected immediately. A week has gone by and no service was ever reconnected. Not even a call from any of the supervisors we left msg for. The actual day of our new location installation no one showed up. We called and spoke to over 10 different people, left msg for multiple supervisor and even spoke to corporate customer service. And not a thing. We are a small company that has suffered greatly because of the lack of consideration and customer service of Comcast. We will be filing a complaint with the FCC and the BBB. Our company has lost potential clients and our customers have also suffered."
"Vera of Bellwood , IL","June 30, 2015",1,"Comcast is the worst customer service in the country. My bill is different every month. I sign up for the 54.99 plan. When I get the bill it's 3x that. And when I call they say ""oh that promotion over. There are no deals."" And the HD boxes that they said would be free for 12 months... you're being charged for those boxes. Thumbs down for Comcast."
"JANICE of Hillsboroughj, NJ","June 29, 2015",1,"I have been having internet connection problems for the past 3 weeks. I keep calling, they reset my box, they send out a technician, he tells me to upgrade my box. I go get a new box, I'm still having connection problems. I now call and am on the phone for 2.5 hours with 5 different people, not one can help me. Another service tech is coming out this Thursday. No they are not. I'm cancelling my service and going with AT&T."
"Karen of San Jose, CA","June 27, 2015",1,Comcast service techs come out to perform work and do not wait to confirm it is repaired. 8 hours off of work to be there for two tech visits and both times the repairman left and it never worked. Customer service has been unresponsive. Policies for consumers are different depending on the call center you reach. Never received call back from service manager and still not repaired and have lost all previous recordings due to swap of box. Customer service rates as the worst I have ever experienced.
"tanya of Chicago, IL","June 26, 2015",1,"I don't appreciate being hung up on by a manager after being on the phone for over 6 hrs trying to fix a mistake one of the salespeople made on my account at the Jefferson park location last night. Last night, I went in to get all new boxes since every box I have has been giving me problems and to rent a router (Whatever I need for wireless internet) because the one I have is a bit slow. The bag I was given had 3 boxes. I just assumed they were the two for my tvs and the Internet box but when I went to install everything, I realized that third box was just wires, not the router thingy. I figured there was just a miscommunication but I then got a confirmation email that listed my monthly fee for the modem I never received.Today I came home and seen that nothing was working so I called customer service. MY FIRST CALL: I talked with two girls who were pretty nice and explained to me that my service is going to a different apartment in my building.. Not mine! Somehow while switching my boxes out and forgetting to give me my router this lady also changed my apartment number. They said they changed it to the correct apartment and put me on hold while they were checking to make sure everything is working. THEN I got disconnected. Now they have my phone number, so why would they not call me back?!SECOND CALL: I asked to be connected with the lady I originally talked to and was informed there was no way of doing that, so I went on and explained my whole situation again only to have the guy not understand. I asked to talk to a manager. Then got hung up on. THIRD CALL: I talked to ** who was super nice. She was not able to do anything. I then spoke with a manager named ** who was also super nice and understood the whole situation. According to her, she was able to fix everything. Everything was working fine.. for about 30min!FOURTH CALL: I asked to speak with a manager several times but for some reason this lady seemed to think she could fix it all. After she realized she couldn't do anything and after wasting my time, she said she'll have a manager call me. FIFTH CALL: The manager called, I explain everything again. She informs me that everything is going to a different apartment and doesn't understand why I WOULD CHANGE MY APT NUMBER IF I DIDN'T MOVE. I had to explain to her that I haven't moved and have no plans on moving several times. She spends about 45min sending signals through to try and get my Internet to work but she's still not understand she's sending them to the wrong apartment. She says I have to deal with a different department tomorrow. I asked since I have her on the phone ""can we go over everything on my account just to at least make sure that's correct because who knows what else the lady last night may have messed up."" So I'm telling her what I'm suppose to have. She ignores me and says to deals with the people tomorrow. I ask again about going over my account and she insists everything on her end is correct and there is no need to go over it. How do you know everything is correct if you don't even know what exactly I'm supposed to have??? Then she hangs up on me! What kind of business is this!? I'll definitely be switching service providers tomorrow!!"
"Jessica of Chicago, IL","June 13, 2015",1,"This is only the third review I have written (the first two were positive), but I have to share my negative experiences with Comcast. I should have noted the red flag and fled to a more reliable company after my first call to Comcast... It was an inquiry about the different packages available and the price. I was on the line for over an hour - on and off of hold - and I didn't get any information. The agent told me she would call back with the information, and she did not.The next day (Sunday) I called again and was quickly able to get a price and schedule installation (I don't know what the woman was doing the previous day while I was on hold!). When I scheduled installation for the earliest date (five days later on the Friday), I explained that my contractor would meet the Comcast technician. The Comcast agent told me the technician would call thirty minutes before arriving. At this point, I emphasized that this was essential because the contractor might need to collect materials. The technician did not call until he was waiting at the front door. When my contractor told him he would be ten minutes, he said he could not wait. I called the technician back a few hours later and he was very rude and unhelpful. When I asked for his name he hesitated and then said, ""Bob."" Clearly an intelligent chap...such a convincing lie! I called him out on the lie and he said he wasn't allowed to give me a name. So...back to the delightful task of trying to get through the minefield that is the automated call system to complain to an agent! I eventually reached an agent, and was placed back on hold. The call lasted for one hour and a technician was not scheduled. She told me she would call me back that evening as soon as she had managed to schedule a technician to come out. Of course, there was no callback. 90 minutes later I called Comcast AGAIN, and spoke with another rude and unhelpful representative. She could not reschedule a technician for another five days. I asked to speak with a supervisor, she told me they would not be able to help. I said I would like to cancel my account, and that I would be reviewing my negative experience, and she said okay. There was absolutely no effort to compensate for the poor service and no apology; this resulted in a terminated account. Recommendations for new providers are welcome... :) In short, DO NOT even attempt to join Comcast; their customer service is non-existent!"
"halona of Reston, VA","June 12, 2015",1,"Despite having pictures of the error messages coming up on my screen directly from Comcast, they will not fix the service. With all the bad reviews, there should be a mechanism for the federal government to protect the consumer against the abuse and criminal treatment by Comcast."
"Reginald of Pearland, TX","June 11, 2015",1,When I moved to our new home I was not aware that Comcast service was not available in my neighborhood. Which forced me to cancel my Comcast subscriptions since I was not able to receive Comcast services (I was very satisfied with the services provided). Now the sticky part it seems that Comcast is dictating where I can live if you have an existing Comcast service contract. If you happen to move to a neighborhood that is not serviced by Comcast you have to pay an outrageous cancellation fee. Mine was $756.82.
"Marlene of Inver Grove Heights, MN","June 4, 2015",1,"I attempted to cancel all services today and Comcast stated I had a binding contract with them via a phone call made in Dec. 2014. I said, ""Well, since you record all conversations, could you please let me hear this phone conversation"". They told me I would have to go down to 5330 South Robert Street in West St. Paul to listen to the verbal phone recording. I went down there and they stated they were unable to have me listen to this recording, but I could call billing department. I said, ""Well previously this morning I spoke with billing, customer service and Loyalty dept."" So they gave me a number and wanted to step aside and I informed them that no you will take care of me first. So I called the number and ** the supervisor tells me nicely to step aside and I say no nicely. The person on the other side tells me I have a binding contract. I said ""ok let me listen to it."" She comes back on the line and says that her team is listening it to it right now. Meanwhile I tell ** that he can talk to this gal. He informs me that he can't talk about my account because that is private. I said, ""Excuse me but you are looking at my account so I'm sure you can talk with this gal on the other end **"". I basically told ** I was not leaving until I received cancellation of service. So the employee then proceeds to tell me that I owe more money as in December my services went from $212.56 down to $199.32. So I owe the difference but she would cancel my service if I paid some $91.00 approx. I said, ""Look you can't show me any proof that I had a contract and I am not paying you anymore. Please stop all service June 30, 2015. I don't want other aging persons to go what I have went thru to get service canceled."" ** told me at one point that I could be sitting on my comfortable couch at home and disconnect services. I told ** I worked this morning at doing so and all I got was the runaround!"
"Richard of Micklton, NJ","June 1, 2015",2,"My bill come for the next billing cycle and has risen $18.28. I had the X-1 platform installed about 8 months ago. The salesman quoted $181.81 for bundle plus services for two years promotion package. I think their rates are high, but OK. I've been paying that amount over the months. Now this month's bill is more with no explanation. I call Comcast for reason and they tell me my account was audited and I was incorrectly billed for extra boxes in my kids' rooms. To bring it back down they would send a service tech to replace the boxes with cheaper boxes. Now I'm in business, If I make a mistake I have to learn to live with it. It's very poor customer relations to send customers increased bill for their error. None of the customer service reps would do anything about it. I don't think it is unreasonable for them to make correct the bill to the original amount. For me it was very important, for them it would have been a small but appreciated gesture. Very poor business customer relationship. I'm disgusted! I have Verizon Fios at work for a reason."
"shannon of Mt Pleasant, SC","May 31, 2015",1,"Basically, my phone was hacked. They were calling me and harassing me to upgrade my service which was bogus. It wasn't Comcast, it was some outside hired help from another country. My monthly payments went way high after a year.. so I am trying to break it off but they are making it impossible. The only acknowledgement I get now is because they want money. Extremely diabolic company!"
"Colin of Chicago, IL","May 26, 2015",1,"Comcast is single-handedly the worst Customer Support I have ever encountered. I don't even know where to begin in my laundry list of horrible interactions. Most recently, after the standard 20-45 minutes of wait and ""verification"" process which requires everything but a blood sample, I was informed that my last request of downgrading my cable service was denied. DENIED. Now, I am going back to AT&T. Not a great option, but better than dealing with this monstrosity of a monopoly ever again."
"Dorothy of Irwin, Other","May 18, 2015",1,They have been over charging me for the past six months. I called in March 2015 and talked to ** and I thought it was resolved. I received my May bill and it has not been resolved. And they can not help me because I need to talk to A BILLING SUPERVISOR and they would not let me do so. I need to talk to a supervisor.
"Emma of Chicago, IL","May 11, 2015",1,Comcast is honestly the most awful company I've ever dealt with in my entire life. We have had some issues with on our demand and have spent 8-12 hours on the phone with Comcast reps. It's not the actual reps fault - it's Comcast! I have no idea how they think the current set up is working well! None of their reps are cross-trained therefore none of the reps are able to answer any questions at all outside of their expertise (not even sure that any really have an expertise). Not to mention we had to repeat the same information to the 6-7 reps we were transferred to even though we were promised these details would be included in the transferred. Comcast doesn't deserve the business they get... I hope some decent cable company comes along and puts them out of business.
"sudhir of Nashville Tn, TN","May 1, 2015",1,"I had a self installation kit sent to my place 3 days ago and installed and then called the customer care for activating the service. After trying out many times and through multiple agents, they could not do it over the phone and recommended to send a technician. Again messed up setting an appointment date which is inconvenient for me and after having no output via the call, was told that they'd escalate the issue and call me back today morning which am still waiting on. This means am basically without internet at my place for at least a week and God knows when I'll get a response."
"Joseph of Rockledge, PA","April 25, 2015",1,"I generally had satisfactory experience with Comcast up until I moved from my apartment to my house in 11/14. I did have an issue with a piece of equipment that was returned through certified mail yet I was charged for the equipment monthly until I moved then I was charged for unreturned equipment. Several tickets and calls led to nowhere so I had given up on it. When I made the move in November to my house I had already set up with Mover-edge to transfer in October. While still in my apartment in October I realized that the Mover-edge didn't use my shut off and start date and instead canceled my current account and generated a new account ""Unknown to me until late"". So I called to turn back on the first account until November. When I moved in to my home I was hit with a past due/ shut off notice one week into moving in, I was overpaid on the first account yet somehow a second account existed that ran at the same time. I paid the 250 dollar shut off notice bill and kept it moving along. I eventually cut the services down to the bare minimum in December. Then I got a notice stating I had another piece of equipment on my account ""The same equipment that was returned over two years ago and also had to pay a unreturned fee."" At this point I had enough. I contacted Verizon and had them come out to install their service in late January and I had Comcast set up to cancel in January I was told that the money from the first account would be paid in a check to me and I returned all of the existing equipment.February comes by and I receive a 30 dollar bill from Comcast that I was more than happy to pay assuming this was the last bill. In March I receive a bill notice for 79 dollars I check my account and I am still a consumer of Comcast somehow. Between 6-10 separate calls from 2/20/15-4/25/15 to cancel service have been unsuccessful. I have been told I would be contacted by management three times. I was promised back pay and also the amount taken from the previous account. Yet another month rolls by and I still have to pay the Comcast bill in order to avoid them from sending it to collections, although I was told not to worry about it and don't pay by two different Comcast employees. I can't even trust them not to bill me nonetheless not send a past due to collections because they said it was ok. I am in the hole for several hundred dollars from unreturned equipment fees that I have receipts for or certified mail receipts for with also paying late fees on bills that shouldn't have existed along with paying for a service I haven't even had the equipment for in over four months."
"robert of Quincy, MA","April 24, 2015",1,"My business relationship with Comcast began June of 2014. I had recently moved into a rooming house with multiple cable hookups and wanted to get internet access. Since they are the only provider in the area I called their ""customer service"" number. I was told that I could easily go to the local office to pick up a self install kit to get up and running. So off I drove to the address they provided and upon entering discovered that I was given the address of their local marketing office! No worries, they gave me the correct address and I proceeded down the road to pick up my easy self install kit. Got to the office-great service, got home, and hooked up my computer to the cable in my room. My computer was online, but my neighboring roommate lost his cable service. Apparently the line that was installed in my room was actually his, so called ""customer service"" and set up an appt to have a tech to install (costing me more $$$). Success! Internet was installed and all was well... but in March 2015 received a call from a Comcast telemarketer offering me cable tv service added to my internet for only 5.00 more a month! Good deal so I said why not, she proceeded to send me an easy self install kit. Upon receipt, realized that with the way my cable was set up I could not self install. Did not want to pay for another tech to come out, so within 3 days took a trip to my local Comcast office and was assured that I would not be charged for the cable TV and my acct would return to the previous billing. Surprise! First week of April received a bill from Comcast. For the months prior to the telemarketing offer I was paying about $52.00 for internet service (overpriced in my opinion, but my only option). The bill was for $105.00!!! Called the customer service # and spoke to a nice guy who said he could credit me $10.00 for the cable tv self install kit, but I would have to talk to a representative in special relations to resolve the rest. He did agree that I should not be charged double for the same service. After being on hold for several minutes special relations rep told me that although I was offered a 30 day money back guarantee by the telemarketer, and I did cancel the cable TV service within 3 days, the offer I signed up for 9 months previous did not exist anymore! After going around in circles with her for several minutes she said she could sign me up for an ""economy"" internet plan for the same price I was paying previously (approx $52.00 with rented modem). She recommended that I pay my bill $95.00 (after the generous $10.00 credit!) and all would be resolved in my next billing period. So I checked out my acct online last week, and guess what??? I am still signed up for a cable TV and internet bundle for $105.00 month!!! I cannot deal with the telephone customer service"" people anymore, so will return to my local Comcast office to cancel everything asap. People should not be treated this way!!!"
"Elizabeth of Bennington, VT","April 23, 2015",1,"I am really surprise that Comcast never told me about rise the bill. That's foolish that I never heard the bill was 179 dollars! Without tell me no letter or no message, etc! Rip off!!"
"Abel of Miami, FL","April 19, 2015",1,"I was waiting for more than two months for new account and they haven't been able to connect the service. The customer service has no idea of how the company work. The subcontractor don't know the policies of the company, they told me to ask the neighborhood where is the box to make the connection to my house. Too bad, too really bad. They can cause a heart attack for sure. They come every week for almost two months for nothing."
"Keissy of Palmetto Bay, FL","April 13, 2015",1,"3 months ago, we activated an acct with Comcast. From day 1, they have been unable to install our service, but have been extremely quick at sending us notices stating we have a balance owed. 5 Technicians that have been unable to resolve our issue and over 15 calls to customer service, to which we have had VERY RUDE, unprofessional representatives disconnect our calls in way more than one occasion."
"Jerrilyn of Wash, DC","April 11, 2015",1,I have called Comcast numerous times and can never get anyone on the line. It's as if they want you to give up and hang up. Don't call trying to get a payment extension. They never answer the phone. What's with that???
"mai of Clute, TX","April 10, 2015",1,"I called in to ask about my bill. They said that they have a new promotion that I can apply. I think that's a good deal so that I agreed to join. At the end of the month, they sent me a bill for $263, with $15 installed kit for internet services. They didn't do a single thing. They scheduled a tech to come out to look to see why I couldn't connect to internet. Over the phone, the lady said that as long as that guy not doing inside my house, they will not charge me. Guess what, they charged me $35 and the tech didn't step a foot inside my house. They charged us $99 for upgrade to their new X1 Platform technology. We have to pay for their upgrade. I don't need X1 platform. And they didn’t even mention that in the call. Do not even think about this company for internet and TV services. Comcast is the worst customer service. You will regret for sure."
"Kim of Machesney Park, IL","April 9, 2015",1,"I am so tired of this company. They are nothing, but a monopoly of ripping people off. I have been a loyal customer since 2008. I have always paid my bill every month. When I signed up I was told what my bill would every month for the package I purchased. I now get a letter in the mail that from my 132.88 bill, that again, I pay every month I now owe $428.11. So, I called and I was told some nonsense about “you must have missed a payment”, but I cannot go that far back. I was upset. How can it be that I have the same package, and I have not missed a payment that all a sudden I owe almost three times what my suppose to be monthly bill is. She told me “well Comcast bills a month in advance. You must have missed a payment”, again she says I cannot go back that far. How could I typically miss a payment and have service? My statements always put me a month behind anyway, because of their ridiculous billing practices. When truly I am never past due. I make my payment every month, just like my electric, water bill, cell phone bill, etc. I have come to the conclusion that I will switch from this awful company. Do they care what their loyal customers or customers think? The answer is no! As long as they can keep making mega dollars hand over foot, while ripping people off they will. It's just disgusting that this is a company."
"Joana of New York, NY","April 9, 2015",1,"It's so frustrating to down $250/month to have trouble with service almost 90% of the time. I get anxiety just trying to change channels. Everything freezes and most of the time I get a ""we are having trouble connecting to the server"" message. Can’t wait to switch to another company. Called customer service more than 3 times, get someone on the other end that is clearly reading from a script and has no idea what they're saying."
"Gary of Seattle, WA","April 9, 2015",1,"Does Comcast (Xfinity) deliberately mislead and tell untruths to its customers? That has been my experience on several occasions. What's that $4.99 a month ""service protection plan"" that I explicitly declined? Why am I being charged $1.99 a month for an ""additional outlet""? Yes, ** in Guadalajara tells me, ""that's a mistake."" So why does it remain on my bill month after month? Why are they charging me $14.99 for Showtime when they told me they are giving me that as a free promotion for a month? I told them that I didn't want Showtime!I've spent way too many hours (and I mean HOURS) on the phone when my new digital set-top box refused to cooperate. On two Sundays in a row I was unable to tune into 60 Minutes on CBS. Error message says 'the channel is temporarily not accessible.' It happens that a number of channels were not accessible. ""Don't worry,"" ** assures me. She promises a refund for the service outages and tells me she will send me an email describing the refund. No email and no refund were ever received. ""We can't email you,"" another customer service representative in the Philippines tells me in a subsequent call. And he adds that they are not authorized to arrange any refunds or tackle billing problems.Does Comcast school their army of customer services representatives to lie to customers? Has Comcast consciously erected walls between billing, tech support and service reps to maximum customer frustration? Do they have a playbook for that? Maybe 60 Minutes has investigated this phenomenon. Unfortunately, I can't see 60 Minutes these days."
"Karen of Buford, GA","April 4, 2015",1,"Needed service -- internet out for days. Was promised over and over that a tech would come out TODAY. Never happened. Then I find a scheduled appointment for the middle of the following week was set up when I won't even be home. Those previous appointments were just the reps making something up I suppose. Have school papers due online, so it's not like I'm missing checking my Facebook and social media accounts. I am incredibly disappointed. Never have I been so disgruntled -- I suppose what makes me the most angry are the lies... I cannot stand that."
"John of Denver, CO","April 1, 2015",1,"Beginning with my signing up for an account in August of 2014, I proceeded to pay for three months of HDTV, DVR, and several channels that never worked. After several attempts to resolve this with communications through both online chats and phone calls, my issue was finally resolved after they agreed to send out a tech to investigate my issue. Once the tech arrived, he proceeded to perform the same diagnostic checks that the original installer had done to no avail. Once completed, this tech eventually checked the connection on the back of my house and found an archaic filter attached to my connection cable. I had been billed, at this point, for 3 months of services I never received. After this semi-competent tech repaired the outdated lines on my home, all was fine for several months. After this issue was resolved, the billing nightmare began. My bills began to reflect payment dates that apparently had no bearing or connection to reality. I was told that my next bill was not due until the normal time of the following month, yet my service was cut off on 3/30/2015. I called in and paid the required ""past due balance,"" and my service was restored. I returned home from work on 3/31/2015 to my television and internet not working again. I called in and was told I was required to pay another $30.00 charge, and could not be told why. I could even expect to pay the superfluous ""reactivation fee"" that I was told I would have to pay on my next bill, but to have to pay two days in a row?Comcast operates under the same tactics as a classic monopoly, and answers to no one. The hoops they require an everyday consumer to pay just for the privilege of watching television is absurd, and I am still paying for their nonsensical package that includes a home phone, despite the fact that one under the age of 94 still uses a land-line."
"Larry of Bellevue, WA","March 24, 2015",1,"The quality of the internet service provided by this company was very poor, with frequent long periods of outages. I called to complain and they said they would send out a technician. The technician said there was nothing wrong with the equipment, even though he made a lot of adjustments to the modem and router, and further adjustments to a box located OUTSIDE the residence. He suggested that the best way to get the ""Wireless"" equipment to work would be to hard-wire it. REALLY. That's what he said. I'm not kidding. I was further shocked to get a seventy dollar charge for this so-called ""service."" When I called to complain about the charge, I was told that the charge was ""Legitimate"" and that Comcast would not remove it. What they will be removing is all of their substandard equipment as I am looking for a more dependable and customer friendly company to do business with. Comcast has ZERO skill in customer service. It is the worst I have ever encountered and I only rated it one star because I was not allowed to give it a zero. Stay away from this joke of a company at all costs!"
"Patti of Port Charlotte, FL","March 22, 2015",1,"Started on install day. No show no call! When I called I was told I'd get a $20 credit and 6 Mon premium channel. Not! After they finally showed 2 days later I had the tech check all the wiring making sure it worked. Not! One main on didn't and that took 15 days before I finally got a competent tech. This was after 4 more no shows or no calls! He fixed everything the first one didn't. My WiFi is unsteady most the time and the guide channel just flips on, it’s on 70% of the time. In less than 24 hrs to fix the quid it happened again as well during daily update it couldn't connect back. Waiting 15 min before I called. It took 1:05 min to get someone on the line. After the update was fixed, she transferred me to wireless. She actually hung up on me! I'm paying this huge amt and they can't live up to service! Anyone else have problems? Join me to force this monopoly to do as they promise! Love to hear from everyone!"
"teri of Springville, UT","March 20, 2015",2,"We disconnected our cable with Comcast because of the lousy packages they provide. In Canada the subscribers can pick the stations they wish to view but not here in the U.S. Because of this, we have intentionally been using ""rabbit"" ears just because we were so discouraged with our service and disconnected it. The stations we were receiving were so much ""infomercials"" and, not to mention, too many commercials, period.Still, my husband became tired of getting up and continually changing the ""ears."" He relented and decided to try the corporate t.v. again, much to my chagrin. As before, when he went to get a box for cable, it didn't work. He called customer service. Apparently, the poor guy in India he was connected to, didn't understand what he needed. So, the next day, my husband drove another 15 miles to get a new box. Surprise! That one didn't work either. In the meantime, our land line was cut off because we were informed that once the cable was re-installed, our phone would be cut off because of the package we chose. So now we haven't any cable AND NO PHONE.Bless the people that work for this company that make millions. They are only trying to make a living. Shame to the corporate shysters. May I ask you something, people that run Comcast? When did you lose your ethics and morality? When did you start believing you were better than the rest of us? Do you have Netflix? Or do you subscribe to your own? I am tired of being screwed around with. Comcast sucks. I know this is going out to the world but a person has a right to voice their opinion. And this is mine."
"Maddison of Bellingham, WA","March 14, 2015",1,"Today we received the bill (even though the website states it's for uses between March 17th thru April, so that doesn't make sense?) and they charged us for a new modem. No, we did not get a new modem, so we called and demanded why we got charged 300% of our normal bill for something that never happened. Long story short, it was a communication error on their end, and we DID NOT get our refund because the person who came out here wrote down that the problem with the internet was OUR fault because we had the wrong router. No, we don't have the wrong router. When we moved in we bought a router specifically for Comcast because they have a list on the website of which ones will work. So they lied? Comcast is 0% customer service and 80% trying to swindle money and scam you. The other 20% is non-American heavily accented Indian people who you can't even understand won't let you talk. So obviously we are completely done here. Either way, all of us are never going with Comcast again. We called CenturyLink and they are coming out first thing Monday. Thanks for absolutely living up to your name as the worst company in America. I have a dated journal of the three strikes your out screw ups Comcast did, and this is a summarized 3rd."
"Jesse of Bellingham, WA","March 14, 2015",1,Every single day I have to reboot or restart my modem. The on-demand works approx. 25% of the time. I am a traveling nurse so I have experienced many companies and this service is THE WORST! I can't even explain how disappointed I am. I absolutely HATE Comcast. Every time I call they always tell me to unplug and plug back in. Horrible. Never choose them if you have a choice.
"Kristy of Nokesville, VA","March 13, 2015",1,"My family and I had signed a 2 yr contract. Two months after contract expired, bill stayed the same. March service cancelled due to non payment of the new amount. Payment went from 170 to 240 back in Dec. Never told of the change. I paid Feb bill. But they said the $240 was past due from back in Dec. I was told they did not have to tell of the change in price after the two year contract was up. I asked since they have no signed contract how can I be liable? Their response was. ""Maybe we should notify customers but we don't."" So I'm stuck paying it. I will never have Comcast again and I try to warn others as well."
"John of Boston, MA","March 12, 2015",1,"I contacted Comcast to set up cable and internet at our new apartment. I spoke with a representative and agreed to a deal where we would get cable, internet, and a DVR for around 100/month. Pretty good. A technician came 4 days later and hooked everything up. The internet worked fine but the cable box was buggy. The next day, I unplugged it and rebooted it which worked for a day and then nothing. On the next evening, I called back and after about 30 min on the phone, the rep said that a technician needed to come and fix it. This was on a Friday and a tech wasn't available until Monday. Monday: tech comes and says a cable was loose and that the box should be fine (I was suspicious, but I let it go). The box was fine... for an hour. When I got home from work, the box is completely frozen and won't change channels or anything. Also, that Monday, I received a bill for $260! I call Comcast, and tech support tries to tell me that I'm using the remote incorrectly. I'm not, I know how to work the remote, I promise you. So needless to say, I'm getting upset. So I tell them that I no longer want their cable service and just want the internet that was advertised at $40/month. They tell me that offer is available to new customers only, and since I am an existing customer, I would have to pay $80/month for the service. Seriously!? That was it, I cancel everything. Unfortunately, there are no real alternatives in my area. Comcast needs more competition. They have so much control that they can easily get away with hidden charges and fees and extremely poor customer service because only they can provide broadband service to a public increasingly reliant on such a service. It's time that we demand an alternative to this corrupted company."
"David of Canton, GA","March 10, 2015",1,My email was held for 2 weeks. This happened 2 times - it was horrible. They offer nothing for what we went through. They actually are allowed to hang up on us. I hate them.
"Elysia of Sterling Heights, MI","March 5, 2015",1,"Comcast, your service really makes you the ABSOLUTE worst company ever! I can't understand how you continue to succeed in business by providing the worst of the worst customer service I have ever seen. No one can help solve a situation, you need at least 10 phone calls with multiple hand-offs where you need to repeat your story again and again and again... well you get it. I am sure you have all experienced it.You are willing to take our payment, did not apply it to the correct account, kept an old account opened when they were supposed to close it and now service is not working. Comcast, or Xfinity - whatever you changed your name to in hopes of having a better reputation, instead of a name change you need to have a business consultant come in or take a few customer service classes or let customers speak to managers who can make a decision or help fix a problem. Billing transfers to support, support transfers to billing, get it together! Instead of the associate not being empowered enough to determine what needs to be done on the phone calls, they all seem to abruptly disconnect. Why not just get a manager, someone from billing and someone from support on the line to hash out the issue, determine a resolution and then take action. This would cost you, the company, less time and money, the customer less frustration and your reputation might actually improve.Other businesses would not be as fortunate (if that is what you want to call it) to still be making a profit. The numbers we have been told to call (not transferred to) include: 866-200-6733, 800-325-7264, 877-896-8678, 877-842-6622, 866-203-8766. We have made multiple call backs (mostly due to disconnections). At what point can customers bill you for their labor in trying to get your assistance on a service you provide? That would be a fair, after all, you charge rates for connections and support depending on what it is."
"Ina of San Mateo, CA","March 1, 2015",1,"I wish I could give it 0 star. The customer service is just non existent. Every time I call for any technical question, they start trying to sell me their crappy additional services that I don't need. My bill has been constantly creeping up with no explanation whatsoever. The customer service is rude and incompetent. The worst part I don't have that many choices. I had Time Warner when I lived on east coast. Their customer service couldn't even go in comparison with Comcast. This industry is totally monopolized."
"Troy of Harrisburg, PA","Feb. 27, 2015",1,"Trying to set up new service, and see what deals were available. First the number we were given went to a line trying to sell several services before patching through to Comcast. Once we called the correct number, the customer service agent (Sasha) was nearly rude, talking over me, and trying to sell me things I had no interest in. I told her so, and she backpedaled, quoting me $10 more for the service than their website offered. I told her I wanted to hang up and call back.She rudely asked what my hesitation was at signing up now. I expressed my displeasure at how the call had gone. She attempted to get me to sign up still, a very hard sell. I hung up, and will never use Comcast service in the area again, as long as there is an alternative."
"olga of Knoxville, TN","Feb. 21, 2015",2,"I signed up for Comcast's xfinity internet and cable TV. Internet was slow. I could not stream videos online. I called customer service. They said let the video upload first, then watch it. The cable TV reception was poor. We could not watch movies on cable without losing a picture (any movie any channel). I called customer service; they restarted the equipment and told me to wait for 2 hours then use it again. Restarting the equipment did not help.On 1/24/15, 2 weeks after I installed the service, I called Comcast and canceled all services. They have a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. Customer service assured me that I will not owe anything because I canceled services prior to 30 days ended. Approximately two weeks after cancellation, I got a statement which claimed that I did not return their equipment and had to pay for the equipment and services that I canceled. On 2/8/15, I called Comcast; a representative told me that he saw that there was an incorrect charge on my account and he will correct my balance.On 2/11/15, I got 2 phone calls from collection agency. Followed by 3 more phone calls on 2/12 and 2/13. I want to emphasize that, according to the statement, my first and only due date is 2/27/15. Comcast sent my account to collection before the due date! I would have never expected this treatment from any company. Comcast truly exceeded my expectations by providing awful services and inappropriate treatment. My balance was supposed to be 0 because I canceled the services within 30 days of customer satisfaction guarantee period and returned the equipment.I also called Comcast on 2/14/15 and a representative told me that they will correct my balance. I called Comcast today, 2/20/15, and I was told that my balance has not changed. I was also told that they cannot see why my balance did not change because their system does not work today. I asked why they send accounts to collection prior to their due date. The representative answered, ""we always send accounts to collection as soon as someone cancels the account"" (paraphrase).I wanted to share my experience because I am hoping that some people will read this prior to signing up for Comcast's services. I do not want anyone to go through the treatment that I am going through."
"robert of Livermore, CA","Feb. 19, 2015",1,My internet goes out a couple times a day. I have to turn off and on the modem. This drives me crazy. I HATE Comcast.
"Duane of Colorado Springs, CO","Feb. 18, 2015",1,"When I was with Comcast they coerced me to set up two accounts so I went from just Residential to Residential and Business. My bill skyrocketed and I was double charged for things like the phone, which was on both plans but bundled, so I paid for it twice. I had so many problems with them and because of the cost I switched to another vendor. I just received a bill this morning for $3,027.78 and I was floored, to say the least. I called them as soon as I could and discussed this with them and they did not budge. When I ended service with them I was not told about any loophole that would cost me this kind of money or I couldn't and wouldn't disconnect with them. The amount itself is incredibly high, even if in the fine print, which most people trust and don't read, if they are like me. The charge was over $2,500 and I suppose late fees incurred as I don't remember getting a bill or didn't open their campaigns to get me back until this morning.Compared to the average household income they are taking about 8% of annual income or one month's income for most people. This is flat morally/ethically wrong to have any company rape you like this. It is usury and not at all within reasonable limits. Signed, Disgusted with Comcast and their BUNDLING??? service???"
"paul of Dewitt, MI","Feb. 18, 2015",1,"My internet key sticker on the bottom was worn out, so I called customer service and was put on hold for about 30 mins. Finally someone got to me after a half hour. The person couldn't even speak English. After being transferred to another person that also could not understand, they transferred me and by the third time the person was at least semi fluent in English. I had to give them a list of my address, name, phone #, SS# and account #, for the woman to tell me it was located under my modem. I told her I knew that but the sticker was worn out. Then she said she can't give me that # over the phone. But yet they needed me to give them my SS# over the phone to someone in Abu Dhabi. I hope more providers start entering the market where I live. I will never come back to Comcast again."
"Donny of Houston , TX","Feb. 13, 2015",1,"This time I got the required cable box and it was packed without the power cord or the HDMI cables. The box did not work and I spent over 3 hours with the representatives trying to activate it. Some of the 5 people I talked to gave long explanations of paragraphs length when 1 sentence would have explained the problem. Finally I was sent to the activation department 3 times including a 15 minute wait to see if the box would turn on when the final customer representative told me ""Not to worry, I will go back to store and get a new box."" I was told to make sure it was tested before I bring it back home. If you are in a monopoly situation, check everything before you leave the store. This is not AT&T folks.I can save Comcast the trouble of utilizing feedback technology to gauge what they are doing wrong with the company service. Just provide the exact same service as AT&T. When I had it, the box never failed and the picture never went out. The customer service people were actually trained and quickly had the answers. They came that day to set up the service where the cables don't spill out, because we have to have cables all over the place since they can get several more times the money from them than if we use wi-fi and no cables. The only problem is AT&T kept hounding me to pay for the maximum service and lied about the costs while avoiding my follow-up questions. Shame, shame, shame AT&T! Cost several times and that turned me off the company. But I guess I should have stuck with them."
"V of St. Charles, IL","Feb. 12, 2015",1,"Terrible customer service. Slow, unresponsive, combative attitude. Price gouging rate hikes after ""Promo"" rate, I think due to the Monopolistic tendencies fostered by not enough competition. We need more telecom competition to foster responsive companies to consumer service and appropriate pricing."
"Daniel of Chicago, IL","Feb. 9, 2015",1,"Since being a Comcast subscriber in September of 2014, the speeds I have paid for have never been what has been promoted. I usually let it slide because speeds can be an ever-changing and difficult thing technologically speaking. However, there are moments in my service, say, for two weeks or more where I will experience speeds so slow the internet is actually unusable and will in fact go out of service on and off. This will make the internet for those weeks completely unusable at times and probably takes up the better part of 50% of the time it is acting up. Recently, the internet in my apartment has been dreadful. I tried to take action by calling 1-800-COMCAST. After going through all of the options, it hung up on me. Time and time again. That number doesn't work at all for me. I then tried calling 1-800-XFINITY. The same things happened. I had to resort to restarting my modem and calling their OK-BEGIN line. I was disconnected, and not contacted back.Frustrated with the absolutely unnecessary trouble I had to go through with simply getting a hold of them by phone, I reported to technical support online. The first person I received technical support from spend half of the time trying to legitimately fix my problem, and the other half trying to push a promotion on me. Desperate for faster speeds I accepted the promotion and got what I believe was a 105mbps speed (this is very fast and should absolutely guarantee flawless internet for myself and my two roommates).The internet worked well for about 2 hours after the online technical support. And then it went back to its same routine of not only not delivering the promotional speeds, it stopped working all together. Infuriated, I tried another online technician. It was extremely difficult to conduct this because my internet was going in and out of service. Finally, the technician changed channels and then asked me to close my browser, expect for her message box, and then reopen it, deleting all cookies and then testing my speed. I was disconnected with her during this process (of course) and from then my internet was a sad sad story.I then FINALLY made a call to Comcast that was answered by way of running across a blog where someone talked about their ok, we're on it number where there is no wait. I spoke with an absolutely incompetent representative who didn't know the number for wireless support and then simply transferred me. On the phone with wireless support, the worker tried to resolve my issue with me and after failing to resolve it, said that my only two options at that point were to either have a technician come out, exchange my modem, or both.So the next morning I took Chicago Public transit all the way down to their office on North Ave. The woman who ""helped"" me....absolutely atrociously rude. Hands down the worst experience I have had with a representative, dare I say....anywhere. I eventually exchanged modems and came back home. After activating my new modem I tried then to connect my own personal router to it because the Xfinity modem/router all-in-one box signal does not reach my entire apartment, but a 20 dollar router from Amazon does.In the process of trying to connect my router to the now functioning internet (still at only 15mbps when I am currently paying for 105mbps) the router would not connect. I called the Wifi support line number, and NEW number that was on the bottom of my receipt. It worked. Thank God. The person I spoke to was simply awesome, actually. His name was Joel, I wish I had asked for his last name. He may have sounded Eastern European or something. Anyways, he worked with me on the phone for over 2 hours (this is not an exaggeration, I logged the call time), to try and figure it out.He came to the conclusion that is this: I am currently getting ""ping boot file shows cdv only"" when I should be getting, ""ping boot file shows wide band.” He contacted billing to see what internet I was paying for to confirm that I should be getting wide band. After helping me uncover this information he then set up a technician time for one to come out and see as he can't hash this out. He gave me a ticket number with the notes he took.He was the only positive thing during this whole unnecessary first-world saga. His help actually inspired me to be a better person in general, because he GENUINELY WANTED TO HELP ME. He never pushed any promotions on me and just tried to figure the problem out. So now....it is currently 5pm central time in Chicago on February 9th, 2015. The technician was scheduled to come anywhere from 3-5pm. I just received a call from Comcast saying that, ""the technician is running behind and will be here anytime after 5pm.” Yes, that is literally the message that was relayed to me. ""...any time after 5pm.”So now I am waiting in my apartment for a ""sometime after 5..."" arrival. I am not even going to proofread what I just typed because I am actually, legitimately tired from mentally processing all of the BS I have been through with this company.That is why I titled this complaint like that in the subject line. Because not only do they have bad customer service. THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD PEOPLE WITH MORALS AND STANDARDS WORKING FOR THEM. Aside from Joel, who I still regret not getting the full name of, this company has actually been the worst I have ever, ever, ever dealt with. I work too. I have a limited income. Of that work, a lot of it has to be done on my home internet. The internet is necessary to me. And Comcast has the balls to absolutely not only give me the finger as a customer, but as a person."
"Gregory of Glen Burnie, MD","Feb. 9, 2015",1,"I have Comcast in Cape Coral, Florida and it's been nothing but a nightmare! From not knowing how to take my account off of a seasonal hold, to charging me full price while my account is on a seasonal hold, and then not crediting my account for $292.08 (as of this writing, it's been over 3 months) because they charged me full price while on the seasonal hold when they shouldn't have done so. Again, as of this writing, I've asked to speak to a manager and I've been on hold for 29 minutes and 50 seconds after speaking to yet another CSR who give me different information from when I previously called. (I waited about 35 minutes only to get another CSR!!! I'm completely appalled!! Now, THAT CSR put me on hold to get a manager)! Comcast has said they've cut a check to me for the $292.08 on December 23rd and on January 29th...It is February 9th and I've yet to receive a check. The Comcast CSR told me that I received a credit when I never did, and I've been on a wild goose chase just to get my money back!! I could go on and on. The bottom line is that I want my money refunded to me. Comcast debits my checking account but says they cannot credit my checking account with a refund. How ridiculous is that?!!

"Richard of Marietta, GA","Feb. 2, 2015",1,"I've been a long Comcast customer, but unfortunately their service has gotten terrible. Comcast cannot get my phone to work and PBS stations don't work. Comcast talked me into triple play and I fell for it. Comcast says I have to reactivate my number with Vonage so that they can transfer it to Comcast. Gosh, they had two months to transfer my telephone number! The PBS stations stopped working last year, and after several calls they did get it working by increasing the power on their system to those stations. Last year they gave me complimentary HBO for all the trouble. The first of the year the same thing happened...the PBS stations are out again. And HBO is gone. Comcast states that HBO was complimentary for 6 months. Clearly not what they told me when they added it last year. It's sad where Comcast service is where it is. We don't have many choices where we are located. Hate to see how much worse it would get if Comcast merges with TW. They already act like a monopoly!"
"Charlotte of Sacramento, CA","Jan. 30, 2015",1,"Comcast has less than satisfactory customer service. The contract package I had with Comcast expired and I selected a new one. When I received my bill, I was overcharged for the new plan. I contacted Comcast customer service regarding an overcharge on my bill. It was resolved over the phone. I was given a lower correct amount to pay. Next month, the credit for the overcharge was added to my bill stating I had not paid my full amount. I called customer service regarding the issue and all the representative could do was re-read my bill to me over and over again. The representative was NEVER able to explain the situation. I told the representative I can read myself, but thanks for your time. I later found that during the transaction of changing from one contract to another, Comcast made an unauthorized credit check on me. This is a HARD check and reflected negatively on my credit report. I had worked 5 years to clear up my credit report. In January all negative reports were dropping off my credit report. NOW, I have a new negative mark on my credit report that will remain for 2 years. Highly upset with the way I was treated during my experience with COMCAST'S CUSTOMER SERVICE."

We couldn't even watch the 49ers game on there. I can't watch The Voice, The Biggest Loser, etc. So I have to watch them on Demand and have to watch all the commercials.

"Alex of Fishers, IN","Jan. 28, 2015",1,"First, start with internet connections (dropped and disconnected time to time). Made phone call and every time they said it's either outage in the area or unplug the power and reset (done it more then 20 times before make some phone calls). After so many calls, customer service rep. said she will ship out new modem (wait for more then 2 weeks) never showed up. Keep using the same modem and worked okay so didn't bother to call for a while. Same issues again so made phone calls and they promised again to ship out the new modem.. over and over for 4 times. And then Jan. 22, 2015 (at this time I even got the confirmation number) rep told me that she will ship out the next day so I can receive pretty soon. Also I was complaint about the rate and she told me that she will give me the promotion rate of $19.99 for next 12 month as well as $49.99 credit for been all that inconvenience..3 days later I received a manual to install but no modem. Wait for another day and never showed up. So made phone call again around 6 pm and talked to 1st rep. She mentions that it's showing that shipped out but not showing that she ordered for next day so it might take a couple of more days. I wasn't happy but I got the ups tracking number and try to see where is at. After I hang up and checked that tracking number but it showed that it has been delivered yesterday (which is a manual) so I was pretty upset and called back and go through all that process again. Patiently wait and talked to second rep and she told me something made me so mad. She said it showed that whoever ordered first time just order a manual not the modem. I said what???So, long story short she ordered again saying that it will ship out tomorrow. After that I asked for some credit for all this bad services and she transfer to somebody else. So I had to explain all that story to her again and she said, ""I'm sorry to hear that and let me talk to my supervisor,"" hold and hold... so far more than 1 hour passed by all total. She came back and said that ""We can give you $20.60 credit for that inconvenience."" After that I asked her to make a sure we are on the same page for the monthly rate and previous credit.I was so upset after she checked and said I don't see any note about the rate and credits. I was about to blow up. My patient are long gone by then. I asked her to talk to her manager and wait and wait again. Later on I talked to her supervisor and explain again. She told me all she can do $20 credit and that's it. I said, ""What about the $19.99 monthly rate?"" She goes ""I have to transfer over to some other department."" So far only 1 hour 30 min passed by. What a joke!!! So I was wait on other line for a while and phone dropped. You got to be kidding right?Called again and go through all that process to talk to someone and had to explain again..... So told me same thing, since no note there she can't do anything about it. Is that my problem, with out any note there? Are you kidding me? I even wrote confirmation number this time for this kind of issue and it does not matter even I had confirmation number or not. They said they can pull up anything. At that point I said go ahead and cancel two of my accounts. What's customer service!!!I will never go back with Comcast and I will post this as much as I can to make a sure that my friends and co-worker can see this. After all that (about 2 hours my valuable time) I mad a phone call to AT&T and talked to someone who was very knowledge and polite to answer all my questions (I wasn't that nice to him because I was pretty upset). I signed up with them after he explained to me everything I asked. We shall see how it goes."
"Cheryl of Woodbury, NJ","Jan. 27, 2015",1,I have a summer residence and have tried calling Comcast on five different occasions to change my service to a basic package while no one is using the home. I have an Escalation Request Ticket # and still no satisfaction. Tried calling five times today and was disconnected each time.
"Andrel L of Detroit, MI","Jan. 27, 2015",1,"After listening to a bunch of ""foreign babble"", nothing was resolved. Comcast has been increasing my monthly bill at 'will', with no real explanations for these billings. They are so sneaky, you have to watch every charge ..nothing stays the same and you never get a straight answer. I have been a cable customer since the late 70's so I guess COMCAST THINKS I WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR MESS. They are mistaken...I have had it. I am switching, I am going to AT&T. Perhaps they will appreciate me as a customer."
"Tim of Winfield, IL","Jan. 24, 2015",1,We have been trying to resolve our internet issues for months - very slow and we are paying for the highest speed. They drilled a hole in our home office and now laid a cable through our backyard without even notifying us. Charge us for technician fees as well - can never get any answer out of them. Our dog got tangled in the outside cable we never knew was there and injured his leg - horrible experience that is still unresolved.
"Robert of Hallandale Beach, FL","Jan. 16, 2015",1,"Unfortunately, we can't rate this company with negative stars. They really deserve minus few stars as a company. They were supposed to install their equipments in my house 2 weeks ago but I'm still waiting to be connected. They sent their bill though even if I don't have any connections. I had at least 6 appointments but I'm still waiting. They never showed up or they saying they'll send someone else because they can't do the work. They should never be in business with that kind of service. You're better trying to negotiate any deals with any of their competitors than doing business with them. Don't waste your time. Avoid them at any costs."
"Annette of Union Pier , MI","Jan. 9, 2015",1,"In November 2014, we declined further service due to increased cost. An offer from Comcast was solicited to continue for an acceptable cost. We had auto billing. Comcast pulled higher amount from checking and refused to refund overage. We called to cancel due to this discrepancy and was told the money was credited and again offered the agreed amount. We have the credit showing in our online account and have spent numerous hours communicating the billing error, however the balance from billing still shows the money due each month with added late fees. Billing has refused to adjust the mathematical error and we are now trying to finally cancel realizing Comcast is inept and not worth the frustration. Today, I tried twice to cancel and was told I was not allowed to because I am not authorized. I am a NOT authorized user in my account? What? This company is insane. My online account has me showing as an authorized user. Comcast claims their systems are different than what our online account is. We were also told that the billing problem was due to systems not communicating. We are done with Comcast. We just can't get them to LET us be done. The service representative could not tell me where to go locally to resolve this issue because her system was down. Seems like their systems are conveniently inefficient except for unauthorized automatic withdrawals. We have been in a winter storm warning with over a foot of snow. Today we are told we can go to a Comcast building and cancel IN PERSON. Why? I just want to cancel. I will take the unit in when it is safe to do so. NOT going to happen with Comcast. I'm pondering my options."
"Craig of Walnut Creek, CA","Jan. 2, 2015",1,"I am a Comcast residential customer, fresh off several phone calls with two different Comcast reps in Billing and, thirdly, a supervisor. The reason I originally called is to inquire about contract renewal pricing, given that I am at the end of my original 12 month promo pricing as of this month. The first two reps insisted I signed up for a ""2 year contract"" when I initially established my service in Jan 2014. I said I wasn't aware of this, that I had no record or recollection of anything beyond a 12-month promotional rate period. When I insisted they provide me evidence of this, the first representative gave me a non-working internet link to follow ""on my own"" to see the terms of my agreement. I hung up and attempted to find the material, to no avail. I called back, and the second rep, ""Geraldo"", said he could not send or direct me to anything, it was just ""what we have in our records."" He further indicated the notes from the first rep reflected that TODAY I signed up for a new 2-year agreement. Whoa??? I asked him to ID the name of the first rep I spoke with, said ""he didn't leave his name"" on the note. (As if the system doesn't record that?!) I very pointedly insisted on a supervisor, was told none was available. (Actually it is believable there are no supervisors of these people.) Eventually after 5 minutes of insisting, I was transferred to Rafael in the ""escalation department.""First off I asked Rafael what is going on in the notes, why the first rep would make such a misrepresentation and why no-one could send or direct me to written evidence of a so-called 2-yr contract. Rafael kept changing the subject, instead tried to find me better pricing, though he could not. So, just to see, I asked Rafael to confirm the contract termination date in their system. THE PUNCHLINE... Rafael conceded I was NOT UNDER A CONTRACT, THAT I WAS PAYING MONTH TO MONTH. I asked why the first two representatives flat out told me I was, Rafael said he did not know, ""perhaps they had the wrong information."" I am inclined to believe Rafael, both because he shares my understanding, and further he is at a separate call center likely not ""in"" on the angle of trying to convince customers of nonexistent contract terms.So, today I had two Comcast reps TELL ME FLAT OUT LIES in order to protect their non-promo pricing and/or keep me from switching. More amazingly there are droves of internet posts that I find going back years on this same theme; either Comcast management doesn't read the feedback, doesn't care, or encourages this sort of thing. All three are reasons not to do business with this fraud of a company. I am cancelling my service, and plan to broadcast far and wide online of my above account."
"sharon of Spokane Valley, WA","Jan. 2, 2015",1,"We have had the house rewired, boxes replaced, you name it. I am getting fed up since they put this in back in March. I am ready to throw their boxes into pieces and they can pick it up in the driveway. It's one excuse after another."
"Teddy of Secaucus, NJ","Jan. 2, 2015",1,"Let me start with I had Comcast years ago. Even then customer service and service in general was a horrible experience. I was on the phone with them at least once per month. Let's just say, my time with them was short. I currently have internet with Comcast as DirecTV doesn't supply internet. My cable service is getting rather expensive so I thought I would give Comcast another try. Wow was I wrong. I placed three different orders online at different times and each time was an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The first time, the tech never showed up. No phone call or anything. I cancelled my request. The second time, I placed an order online and selected a desired date. I received an email stating my order is not finalized and to call customer service. I did and rep tells me that date isn't available. I cancel again since no other dates were available. The last time, once again I placed an order online, received an email and called customer service. Apparently, the prices listed online isn't available in all areas. Yet when I log onto my account, a screen pops up asking to upgrade. Now correct me if I'm wrong but if I have a profile, it automatically reads my location. So why can I not get the package I ordered. So the idiot rep tells me only two packages are available and I can't get anything else. After arguing for about 20 minutes, I told her to forget the whole thing and I'll wait for FiOS to be installed in my area. Please stay away from Comcast. They sucked then, they suck now and nothing will change."
"Savannah of Maple Valley, WA","Dec. 22, 2014",1,"I wish I could give them negative stars. I had Comcast for about 5 months. Everything was fine until I had to move, then I started getting the runaround from hell. About a month before I moved, I called to set up cancellation/reinstallment dates. That went fine & I asked if I could take my router with me. ""Yea, of course!"" was the response I got. Everything was fine. Then THE DAY BEFORE I moved, my roommate came to me saying she went into Comcast, cancelled my service for me (which she was somehow able to do without being authorized on the account) & told me I needed to mail back my router & CABLE BOX.Whoa, whoa, whoa. 3 very wrong things there. One, how was she able to cancel my service? Only I was authorized on the account. Two, mail back my router? I was told I could take it with me to my new home & do the self-install. And three, mail back what cable box??? I never signed up for cable, nor did I ever receive one. So I called in & got bad news after bad news. I was told the wrong information about the router - I had to mail it back, indeed. As for the cable box, Comcast's all knowing computer system said I had one & it had to be mailed back. If I didn't - BOOM, $130 fee. I couldn't mail back the router, I had to leave first thing in the morning. So that's an $80 fee for being told the COMPLETE WRONG INFORMATION. This was about a week ago & I'm still dealing with people on the phone. No lie - whatever you're told literally depends on the person you talk to. NO ONE knows the same info. On my gravestone it's going to say ""DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH COMCAST""."
"Dan of Saint Clair Shores, MI","Dec. 22, 2014",1,"I just ordered Comcast and we are already getting off on the wrong foot. I was told in the beginning that they would waive my technician fee and when I got my first bill it was not taken off. When I called them to discus my bill, the customer rep. said no problem and the changes would take 24hrs to reflex my online bill. Well, 3 days later and it was still at the same price. ""NOTHING WAS TAKEN CARE OF."" I called again and after listening to the next customer rep. chow down on food while hearing her typing (thinking something was happening). She spoke to me 5 min later and said that it would have to go to the supervisor for review and I would receive a call from the supervisor by the end of the day. You guessed it! NO CALL BACK. This could go on forever because they are great talkers & great liars. GOOD LUCK WITH THIS COMPANY ""PEOPLE"". ""Dishonesty is so grasping it would deceive God himself, were it possible."""
"Emanuel of Baltimore, MD","Dec. 13, 2014",5,"Great Company to work for but in certain areas they have the wrong people running the show. I believe it should be a complaint line for customers and techs. This is a major problem for techs. Just had a guy to get fired over a job that was done to Comcast specs (code) with notated information on the work order that was over looked by management. One and a half months later the customer received a bill due to the work that was completed. Now a complaint from the customer because they did not expect the bill to be that expensive. They now blame the tech for the work done when the customer acknowledge and had a full understanding of what was going to take place and it was agreed upon. The tech had to pay out of pocket to the customer 300.00. After the customer cashed the check, she still was not satisfied and called in and had the tech fired. The tech had all records and valid information on the work order just as requested by management. Wrong doing."

"Melanie of Douglasville, GA","Dec. 9, 2014",1,"Warning - if you are considering it PLEASE don't switch your satellite service to Comcast. They are the WORST, poor customer service, poor internet service, constant error messages and corporate clowns with excuses about the service!"
"Cristine of Frederick, MD","Dec. 4, 2014",1,"My internet service went from standard speed to high speed without notice. I only use it to open emails and surf social media. When I called to have it changed it back to standard speed (at a much lower price), they informed me that there was a $2.99 charge for account changes. The digital service that everyone was required to change over to was a scam so that people couldn't get free television. They continue to raise rates yearly, and now have instituted a policy to charge for changes."
"Kathleen  of Salt Lake City, UT","Dec. 2, 2014",1,"After wasting my morning making 6 (being conservative, could have been more) calls to Comcast, speaking to 4 agents and 2 supervisors, in addition to being disconnected twice, I have some hope of receiving a refund on my xfinity account in another month, having disconnected my service over 3 weeks ago. They assure me that it will take a month. This was after weeks of their calls telling me I had to return their equipment, of which I have none, and my calls to them to confirm that I have none. But their calls still continue and they will not issue my refund because I still have their equipment which they confirm I have none. They also claim that they came to my house to connect me with Comcast TV, which I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole; I am a DISH customer. Still with me? Having dealt with them unhappily in the past, I hesitated, but against my better judgment I did it to myself again, hence, my current regret. In their case, you can believe all of those nasty things you read on the internet - an example that some things you read on the internet are true after all. Buyer beware!"
"Alex of Monongahela, PA","Dec. 2, 2014",1,"Needed a service call to attempt to fix an issue with slow internet speeds (less than 12mbps when I am paying for 100mbps) and the tech who came to my home was angry, combative, and refused to listen to any of my concerns and basically said ""there is nothing I can do"" and left. He was supposed to get someone else who could help to come out but I found out today he never did. Now I have the 4th tech appointment set up to fix an issue that has been ongoing for over a month. If I had a choice I would change my internet and cable company, but unfortunately Comcast is the only option where I am currently living."
"GRIGORY of Somerset, NJ","Nov. 27, 2014",1,NO CABLE SERVICE ON THANKSGIVING DAY. No image on screen on all channels. Voice content on all channels same.
"Robert of Ardmore, PA","Nov. 14, 2014",1,"I spent 5 hours on the phone yesterday and waited for a service technician for 4 hours this morning and he never showed up. Also, I spent another hour on the phone today. It started when 1 of 4 TVs did not have service. I called and when they sent a signal I lost all 4 TVs as well as my internet. After another 1.5 hrs on the phone, I had to leave for work as I was already an hour late. I called again when I returned home and after 50 min on the phone (getting signals) a supervisor finally came on and all service was returned in 10 min. After hanging up I realized that I didn't have the TV packages I paid for (including Thursday night football) so I had to call back again. The service rep I spoke with sent another signal and I again lost all 4 TVs and my internet, then got disconnected. This morning I waited 4 hours for a Technician who never came. I spoke with Leslie, a Customer Experience Executive, who said they couldn't the technician out today and that I didn't even need a technician as the problem was internal. Now I do not have any service, I missed 5 hours of work, I spent almost 6 hours on the phone with Comcast. Is this how Comcast treats its customers?Updated on 11/14/2014: By the time I had service restored I spent a total of 10 hrs. on the phone and missed 2 mornings of work. Diane from the corporate office of ""Bryan Roberts"" called several days later to see if I was satisfied. She followed up 3 more times, gave me her phone number in case I need to reach her. I was offered NOTHING for my time (evidently Comcast doesn't believe anyone's time is important other then themselves).I received my bill in December and the charges were doubled. I wanted to just ignore the charge but I know eventually they would just cut my service off. It must be good being the gorilla in the room without competition. (I thought the US broke up monopolies with the break-up of Bell Telephone). I called Diane, as she instructed me to, 5 times over the next week and never got a call back. So I called again through the normal number (experiencing a higher than normal amount of calls - hold 20 min). After another hour they removed the over charge and gave me a discount of $33, which comes out to under $3 hr. Oh yes, I earn approximately $200 per hour! I tried reaching Diane again but I guess they REALLY DON'T care about their customers.I guess at this point I'll go through with switching to Verizon because they couldn't be any worse and I know Comcast couldn't care less. Comcast wants to buy Time Warner??? That's exactly what this country needs! Any other business in America would be out of business treating its customers as Comcast's does. Now I understand why Comcast has the most complaints against it, including the most complaints by it's own employees. It's disgusting!One day I'll have the patience in telling the stories from my businesses. It's just about as frustrating except, even Verizon doesn't provide the services in my area I need. There is ONLY Comcast. Comcast doesn't care about their customers, employees or services. Just rake that money in because there is nowhere else for customers to go!"
"Gina of Goose Creek, SC","Nov. 11, 2014",2,"I woke up this morning perfectly content with the new service agreement I made with COMCAST last week. Then today, an agent called me, and promised me more service for less money. I don't care about ""more service"", but I like ""less money"", so I agreed. Then I noticed there were fewer channels, the service they added is something I don't even want, and the monthly price was higher!Long story short... I ended up spending my afternoon on the phone with multiple reps (mostly on hold), just trying to get back what I had, when I woke up this morning. The result - I have to pay even MORE, and was called a complainer.... I was content this morning. THEY called ME. I have been a loyal customer of Comcast for years. They do not appreciate my business. I am not happy with COMCAST. I don't recommend using Comcast if you have another option... any other option."
"Mike of Langhorne, PA","Nov. 4, 2014",1,"If you're thinking of getting Comcast, run away while you still can. On top of being the most corrupt company on the face of the earth, Comcast systematically belittles their customers and gives absolutely 0 ** about their service. As someone whose put up with it for 15 years, I can finally and thankfully say I'm going to throw all of my cable boxes against the glass of their shiny new skyscraper downtown and tell them all what they can do with them.I used to go to their branch on Northeast Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia, but they just put a sign outside saying the store has been permanently shut down. The sign encourages people to take their plethora of problems to the Langhorne branch near Oxford Valley Mall. Annoying, but whatever. I just waited an hour and a half in that line and, guess what? They can't help people who live in the city because their branch is in the suburbs. Are you serious?8 months ago, when I went in to talk about my dismally slow ""Power Boosted"" internet, the consultant at the Northeast Branch told me Comcast has a special running where, if you purchase the $139.99/mo HBO-infused triple play, you do not have to pay ridiculous equipment fees. Sounded good to me, so I signed up. Sometime later, I get a letter from Comcast telling me that there was an error and my account and I can expect fee(s) up to $50 extra to show up, per month. I go back to the same guy and he swears on his mother that I ""misheard"" him. Yeah, enjoy your commission while screwing the neighborhood into services they don't want when all they're trying to do is make their bill competitive.This entire corporation is a sham. The FCC lets them buy Time Warner and somehow it's not a monopoly. Lol. And yet, somehow, I, as a teacher, pay the same tax rate as Brian Roberts, the CEO who doesn't even live in the city his company apparently flagships as its headquarters. I'm switching to Verizon tonight and I seriously hope nobody reading this decides they'll get roped into Comcast's lies."
"Cristina of Orlando, FL","Nov. 3, 2014",1,Comcast has so many call centers outside USA that suppose provide a customer service but is a scam. They take from you a personal information. Be aware if you dial the right customer services in USA.
"Matthew of Tomball, TX","Nov. 3, 2014",2,Several times a week my tv service is interrupted because of problems comcast is having with their transmissions. No technical information is given and when I complain they send someone out but the problems still continue.. Yet my monthly bills remain the same and no consideration is given for the inconveniences that have occurred. Would I have a similar problem if I went with another provider?
"Nick of Chicago, IL","Nov. 3, 2014",1,"We recently moved. We planned ahead and contacted Comcast prior to the move. We told them we wanted service cancelled and connected on the same day at the old and new locations. So far so good. When the day of the move came, our technician came to install our cable. Our internet transfer was not on the ""ticket"" and this is where one of many issues began. Our signal was 'too weak' according to the technician and he needed to return. Our technician left with incomplete cable service and no internet.That evening, I called into customer service to potentially troubleshoot to see maybe it would get fixed. This customer service rep informed me that a technician is scheduled to come the following day, however I did not need to be present as it was outside work. The next day, the original technician did not return, however, I did receive a call informing me that a technician was knocking on my door. Remember, I was told that I was not needed to be present. So they rescheduled. I call into customer service again and tell them what happened. Again I am informed that I do not need to be present. 4 days pass and a technician is scheduled to come between the hours of 8 am - 8 pm and that I would need to be present. When I called into Comcast at 8:05 to inform them that the tech was a no show, they said, a tech was at your home. ""Uhh, what? No they were not."" After it was escalated for a THIRD time, I was told that a tech would come on Sunday between 8 am - 8 pm. I called into Comcast just to double check. They informed me that no appointment was scheduled for Sunday but another appointment was scheduled for Monday. While I appreciate that every CSR has been apologetic for my experience, I have yet to see resolution. Own up to your mistake and do not lie to your customers as you have 3 times with this one."
"Jimmy of Broward, FL","Oct. 29, 2014",1,"I'm going to make this short; this company isn't worth my time. I signed up for 79$ service. My first bill is 363.

She goes, ""first bill is always higher.""| I said I wanna cancel and send everything back. She told me to ** off and hung up on me.

"Mark of Greenbelt, MD","Oct. 27, 2014",2,"I'm a new customer, and I have yet to be connected for service. Upon signing up, COMCAST never told me about any delays with installs, and that I would be subjected to wait almost (3) weeks for my service to be connected. It took (3) separate calls to COMCAST customer service for a rep to finally tell me about my actual scheduled service connection date. I asked for a phone number to the local COMCAST service installer who receives the work orders for my area in an attempt to possibly change the scheduled appointment date. I was given a number to call. I tried calling the number, and no luck, could not get through. So, I called COMCAST ""customer service"" back, and received another number. It was also bad. Both had voice messages stating this number is not receiving calls at this time. Comcast service is poor!! This is what happens when a company gets too big! The service goes downhill!!

I spent 2 days on the phone with them to solve the issue. They solved it. I went 3 times to customer center because the first 2 times they gave me wrong modem and cable box and I spent 3 hours on the phone with the technical support then they figured out that the modem and cable box were not working and that I had to go again to customer center and to the line and request a new one..TWICE!After a month I then chose to cancel my service because all of these issues and they answered me that I am a VALUED CUSTOMER and that they wanted to offer me a better rate for $45 a month. I accepted it. I checked my account after 24 hours and I found again a bill for 129$ my monthly rate that was originally 69$ and that should have become $45 was instead $85! Then the balance was for installation (I already had everything installed as you can read on top) and other weird charges. I am still trying to figure out how to find a solution. DO NOT DO COMCAST.

After trying for a day, I succeeded to reach Comcast customer service and the agent re-activated the subscription but could not understand why and by whose authorization the HBO subscription was removed.

"Tricia of Chico, CA","Sept. 27, 2014",1,"I used to pay 17.99 for the SAME EXACT cable I have right now, that is 89.99!!!!! I guess the guy put me on a year deal last year and I had no idea it was a year so it fell off and I was on an 89.99 double play bundle. The hidden fees they added in were: 10.00 for faster speed for internet, 8.00 for a modem to rent, 1.99 PER room for a dumb little box that I used to NEVER have to buy before they went digital and every kid has a TV so that's 5 boxes at 1.99, so right there we have over 30.00 in silly misc charges! Shouldn't cable come with boxes? Shouldn't internet come with a modem? ATT never charged me for a modem ever! I only changed because the gaming teens needed faster internet! Anyways, my bill was 89.99 plus apx 30 for that junk and now my 120.00 bill is 160.00!! It went up 40.00 and they refuse to put me on a new plan till I asked for a supervisor then I got a guy who was RUDE, like normal and then he finally gave me a new deal but its 10.00 more per month! They could NOT do my same deal.. It seems it goes up every year higher and higher. Its ridiculous! I have the smallest package! I used to pay 17.99 for the SAME SERVICE! We need another service provider to come here locally so we can get away from being forced into this cruddy service. I hate paying this high rate for out of the country customer service anyways. I cant understand them and they cant understand me! I'm in America, paying American prices, give me an American agent please! This is ridiculous and I will be finding some other place or give up TV! My bill is 160 a month now for BASIC CABLE only! I have no fancy stuff whatsoever and I'm done! The cable doesn't work half of the time and the signal is always one bar and cuts in and out all day every single day! Also for three years or more, ABC on channel 7 has not worked right and the digital squiggly's and lines go haywire and I cant see the dancers on dancing with the stars ever! Irritates me to no end but I get NO credit for it either and I cant see my show! Someone needs to start a class action and the government needs to shut them down or monitor them or something!

I have had internet problems since I've have them, and a tech has came out 4 times...the 3rd time they were suppose to bring a new modem, and failed to do so, but still charged us for it. My bill is wrong pretty much every month, and this month has probably been the moment that has taken the cake. The last time I called, the conversation went on for about a total of 2.5 hours with 3 or 4 reps to get my bill adjusted and fix my internet service that was not working AT ALL for some reason. A representative initially said that he would reimburse us for the days that our service wasn't working (which means every day we called in, which is hardly anything considering the fact that who is going to call Comcast everyday) and I began to tell him that that was not satisfying enough. Then he told me that he would reimburse me for the time (14 mos) that I have been paying them for the modem. I was ok with that. So, now I call in to pay my bill, the credit is not on there. OF COURSE! The rep I initially talked to said there are no notes stating that promise, so I told him to pull the call. He says only a supervisor can do that...I say fine. He transfers me...after 10 mins of waiting on hold, Anna answers. She tells me that I am NOT going to receive that credit because it isn't applicable and refused to pull the call. ""So your reps just make up numbers and promises to get me off the line?"" And she says, ""I'm not sure what he said."" PULL THE CALL!! She refuses and tells me there is nothing she can do for me. I said, ""you call this customer service?"" She says, ""yes."" Wow....The fact that I have issues every month isn't enough already? The fact that they can see my account and the amount of times I have called in and complained, and had appointments to have reps come out isn't enough. She is a supervisor and refused to give me the credit I was promised. EVEN if it was an error on the behalf of the rep that promised it initially, she did nothing to fix the issue and gave me NO customer service whatsoever. I have been EXTREMELY patient with this company and I have just been screwed over. I pay way too much money for them to treat me the way that they do, and for my service to be this terrible!!!!! I am strongly considering a lawsuit. Calling them every month takes way too much of my time, when I just have to call the next month because something isn't fixed. I have began to hate this company simply because they do not care about me as a consumer and I am regretful for giving them a chance."
"john of Brigantine, NJ","Sept. 17, 2014",1,"Comcast representatives lied about the total charges per month. After going over all equipment, fees, tiers of service, etc. I was guaranteed to keep all of my old channels and all of the same terminals and equipment including my dvr for a total of 135 dollars plus tax. 2 days after installation my channels changed and I had to call them to have it reinstated. Then we get a letter saying that we have not been charged for two terminals and our bill will be going up 16 dollars. After several calls then waiting for a supervisor to call back, all I get is there's no way anyone quoted me that price - although they won't check their recording to verify. I was careful to verify everything item by item and had her repeat everything included and the total price before taxes. They choose to call me a liar and won’t check the recording that she guaranteed would be on file if there was any discrepancy. (I did this because they've lied prior.) Why can't they check the recording and honor the deal that they made. I'M IN FOR A LAWSUIT! SOMEBODY PLEASE STOP THE LIES TO SECURE OUR BUSINESS!"
"Mike of Denver, CO","Sept. 8, 2014",1,"So I spoke with Comcast again today. Last week we had outages and this week we are starting out with more outages. In this digital age we are in dire need of reliable phone and internet services for our company which operates predominantly online, however in the past year I have been in charge of the account our business has had over 15 outages that have disrupted our business.Each outage or service disruption leaves our clients in a lurch because they cannot contact our business and in turn, business is lost. We are credited for the service for the day, but a measly $10 maximum credit is minuscule in comparison to the amount of business we have lost. My colleagues and I want to work with a business that has ethics, customer service, great products and reliability. Why is this so hard to find with an Internet and phone provider? Get your act together Comcast."
"Beth of Amherst , MA","Sept. 7, 2014",1,"I contacted Comcast, reluctantly, after hearing of so many fraudulent practices, but they are the only gig in town. I called to order internet and cable service. I was told that I would get internet service and a basic cable service with 25 channels for only 39.99 and was also told that I couldn't get internet service only (I don't watch TV). I set up an installation date, rearranged my schedule to meet their needs and never received a confirmation letter. In the meantime, I needed internet service so I went to their website which states that you can receive free wi-fi through many different hotspots. They did provide me with a free hour of service. When the service expired, I went back to looking for the free ""hotspots"" and connected to a secure free x-finity network. However, to get service, I had to pay 19.99, nothing FREE about that, which would take me up to the day they were coming. I called them on that day to confirm and they said that my installation date was a week from that date. I explained that I had been told that day and they apologized. I then asked for a credit for the 19.99, as a courtesy, plus the 19.99 I would be charged for the extra week, plus the 19.99 for the other computer in the house (the 19.99 connection can only be accessed through one device).The customer service rep. put me on hold and came back and said that my bill would reflect a credit from the 70.00 monthly fee that I would be paying. I asked for the original price quoted, plus email confirmation of the installation date, plus credit for having to pay a weekly fee on each computer. I was told I would receive those emails in 5 minutes or so. I received no notification. How did I resolve it? I chose VERIZON instead. I can't get cable TV through them, only satellite, but I wasn't lied to and am not having money extorted from me. Why Comcast is allowed to continue to function under their current fraudulent business practices is beyond me."
"Douglas of Chico, CA","Sept. 3, 2014",1,"I am now having to address my concerns, issues, and problems, that relate far back as June 2, 2014, when I first placed a phone call to Comcast (1-800-934-6489) to find out and determine the cause(s) of my changes in billing from $54.29/month to $79.46/month (billing date 05/20/2014). On 06/12/2014, I called and first talked to a Renz, from the Philippines, then a Munide and also to Erma. I was told that my current TV & Internet (Double Play) program offer had expired and I need to either pay the new fees or obtain a new offer/deal that was available. I was offered a Triple-Play offer for $84.99. I told Renz I had not had to pay for my new/recent updated converter boxes/equipment, that I currently had, and that I was not and did not want to pay for any new converter boxes/equipment. Erma then told me she wasn't able/authorized to give or provide me with discounts or reductions, so she then connected me with Darrell, in the customer Loyalty Department.Darrel, from the customer Loyalty Department, told me that in order to get my equipment without fees he would have to give me a reduction, or/and then after 6-months I could call back and get an additional discount of $10.00/month for 6 months!!! I never receive his/that discount. Then, on 06/12/2014 @ 2:40PM, called Comcast again, 1-800-934-6489, trying to get my phone line connected, and working, as I had received my Arris TM22G Internet/voice modem and I was told by calling the Comcast technicians could connect and get my phone working. I first talked to a Catherine in the Porting Department (877-397-9734). Catherine told me that I had to call and talk to the 'Telephone Coding Services' people which was a recorded message and set of instructions to get my old phone number changed from AT&T services, over to, and converted to my new Comcast phone service. She also told me that my current or existing phone number was **.I had some questions about the setup and needed to call back, but in the process Erica answered the call @ approximately 3:00PM, and she introduced herself, and told me that she saw my vast list of problems and as a Senior Comcast employee that had word in many departments including the Loyalty Dept., in the technicians dept. and now she was in the Sales Department. She told me that, I will give you free installation as it was an available deal/offer that day, along with my getting an upgrade to the new X-1 program, that was offered and all for the same price of $84.99 per month service fee(s). I told her about the $10.00/month discount that Darrell gave me back on June 2, 2014 and she told me she/they would also apply that discount as well.Well I still am getting billed for an extra undisclosed, and UN-agreed to and additional Fees of $10.00/month for some HD Technology Fee each month!!! This is wrong and I consider it to be a form of Bait-and-Switch [the action (generally illegal) of advertising goods that are an apparent bargain, with the intention of substituting inferior or more expensive goods], scamming, Deception and or even fraud. To expound and illuminate the vast problems and concerns of Comcast Customers you only need to go to the Web (**).I have repeatedly talked, and went down personally to the local Comcast office here in Chico, CA. @ 427 Eaton Road 95973, and Talked with a ** and also to the/his Assistant Store Manager **, and to this date, I have yet to get or have gotten a single viable or reasonable results to my concerns. Comcast has yet to produce any viable evidence, recordings, documentation, or results to disprove my claims to my original, and only, agreement to the $84.99/month total fees/month for 12 months. Comcast has also and yet even give me a single contact by phone by anyone who can, and will be able to resolve my ongoing issues & conflicts with my wrongful billings, and/or to be able disprove my original agreement that was in agreement to the $84.99/month service fees for my current 1 year or 12 months Deal Offer, that I received back on June 2, 2014 from Darrell in Comcast Customer Loyalty Department and to my/our agreement made by and in which I also made with Erica back on 06/12/2012 @ 3:00PM!If all this is not bad enough, this month I was charged/billed for $4.99 rental fees for a movie called Divergent, in which I ONLY viewed as the/a Trailer, just to see if it was even worth seeing in the first place. What kind of company is constantly and consistently allowed to get away with this kind of corruption, and receive NO corrective actions or compensation for Their Wrongful Action, Doings & Billing Practices, I ask you? So now I have to ask, What is it Going to take, after three months of no results, to get this wrongful billing resolved, TODAY!"
"Gail of St. Augustine, FL","Aug. 25, 2014",1,"I have been waiting for 2 months for Comcast to come and repair a line from the street to my house. There is a temporary patch, so I get service, but it is sticking up out of the ground. On the 3rd call to get them to come out to my house, a rep. offered to upgrade my service for the same rate I was paying to help with my frustration. So, stupid me, I said sure! Then I got my next bill from them. The 'deal' turned my $100 per month bill to $187. After a 40-minute phone call in which I attempted to get my original plan and rate back, it turned out to be unavailable. The best they can do is return my service to what it was, and charge me $120 per month. They are thieves. I'm sure that I wish U-Verse or Bright House would hurry up and come to my neighborhood. And, PS, that cable is still sticking out of the ground."
"Jackie of Rockford, IL","Aug. 24, 2014",1,I am the one always taking care of our bills. The Comcast account is under my husband's name though. I have not had any problems paying the bills by phone. However I have had questions about our bill and I called them to ask a simple questions about our bill. They asked my husband's ssn and I gave to them. They told me they could not give me any information because I was not my husband. I just want to pay the bill!!! My husband is working overseas. I told them that but they still don't answer my questions. I was so frustrated but they are the only guy out here so I can't switch service. I have had other issues with them too. What else I can do about this?
"Jan of Westland, MI","Aug. 8, 2014",1,This has happened a few times with me. They give you a price for a service - when you don't get the service you call back and they say the person you talked to did something wrong! This time after the promo I tried to downgrade. I remove some service like phone Movie Channel. I left the house - when I came back no tv at all. Support said happens all the time. Called rep to get it back on. Now I'm paying more than before I called and have less service!!!! Mm.
"Lorraine of Wexford, PA","Aug. 6, 2014",1,"My internet does not work. I work from my home and need it to perform my job. I have been trying to get through to them all day. Very long wait times. I got through and they hung up on me. They are also my phone provider so they certainly know how to call me back but they made no attempt. I went to the web page and all I could find was self service information telling me how to do their job for them troubleshooting their equipment. I can't even get through to stop the auto pay on my account. What is a consumer's recourse? They have direct access to my $$ for payment but do not have to provide the service I have contracted them to. Read the internet, I am not the only one. How do they get away with this? A rating of ""1"" was too generous but it was my only option..."
"Ajay of Burnsville, MN","July 31, 2014",1,"I have been with Comcast for more than four years with only minor complaints. I wanted to cancel my service last year because their promotions ending every 3 months and spending hours to get new promotions to keep my bill in check. I was convinced by the rep when I called to cancel that he will give me promotional rate of 139.00 for 24 months. I asked about early termination fee if I move, and was told they can move my services free of charge and if they do not have service in the area, there will not be any termination fee. Lo and behold, after 9 months of contract, I called their moving services and asked to move my services. I was told that they do not have services in that area but their partner company Charter can provide services. I contacted Charter and got my services installed. Now the phone tag and nightmare of cancelling Comcast has started. Today I called them and ask them to disconnect my services and was told that there will be an early termination charge. I tried explaining the situation but to no avail. I asked to speak to a supervisor but they don't have one so I was put on the call back list!! Now our moves should be decided by the cable company contracts and not the job offers. Would not recommend Comcast to anyone if there are other other options. Bad luck if no other options!! Stay away from verbal commitments from Comcast reps as they will mislead, deny everything and will not take ownership."
"Rene of Franklin, TN","July 29, 2014",1,"Let's face it... we all know that cable companies are an oligopoly in the US and they should all be at least fined or at most be in prison for their business practices. Bottom line: they sneak charges on your bill. We have the HD Complete XF Bundle with the X1 DVR system. With this system, we have the X1 master DVR in the living room and are allowed up to 3 additional HD outlets for free. We have 4 additional outlets in our home and should thus be charged for one additional outlet per month. Well, this month, our bill seemed much higher than usual and lo and behold, out of the blue, they started charging us for 4 additional boxes at $9.95 each. I have been live chatting with them for over an hour and the woman who is likely in India or Pakistan keeps telling me that the extra charges are for my X1 system. She cannot resolve the fact that this is a NEW CHARGE on our bill this month.Prior to this problem, we went for 4 months without functioning DVR service. We were on the phone with Comcast weekly and they kept telling us that the problem would be resolved within 24 hours. Finally, we had to pay to have a technician come out to our home. He said that they had given us equipment that should have been sent back for repair. So, the previous guy had taken faulty equipment from another person's house and gave it to us. Isn't that lovely? Here's the best part: guess how much they refunded our account for having their crappy malfunctioning equipment for 4 months? Have you guessed?$7. Mind you...this is not even a $7 discount per month. It was a total of $7. After screaming and fussing on the phone, I decided that my blood pressure and sanity were more important because I was getting nowhere with them! They argued that they provided the services as they had promised but that we were unable to take advantage because of the faulty equipment. I am not kidding here. But we only had faulty equipment because one of their technicians gave it to us!So, what am I going to do about this? Absolutely nothing. But why you must surely be asking yourself, would I not do anything!?! As stated in the introduction, we have no other options. The cable companies represent a legal monopoly. Last I checked, the US was still a free market environment but yet the gov't is allowing this oligopoly to continue. If y'all want to band together and rise up, I will stand with you. In the meantime, I will spend the next hour or so on hold with India because they have still not resolved my issue over the past 20 minutes it took me to draft this review."
"Sheila  of Albuquerque, NM","July 15, 2014",1,"I have been having with my Comcast Phone etc. (I have a bundled package) for 2 years now. In addition, I have paid for a service protection plan all along as I was told that I needed it to avoid the charge for a visit to me. However, it is a Comcast problem not my problem. The last technician checked and my neighbors who use Comcast also have the same problem. He said it is their own cable, not my lines. However, I can't get anyone to fix it in spite of my many calls and the many hours I have wasted. I am still losing phone calls, I can't hear other person, they can't hear me, overlapping conversations, yet I have been paying for service and been complaining for two years now and not getting service. Friends and family complain about not being able to hear me. I have gotten some credits after calls to Comcast but some credits were for Comcast errors in billing and some other reasons which I won't take the time to go into here.I want reimbursement for the unnecessary payment of the Service Protection PlanI have been an 8 year Comcast customer but this does not seem to mean much to Comcast and will probably get worse when the merger with Time Warner is complete. Two years of lack of decent service, the many hours of my time wasted between the many phone calls to Comcast and the time when useless Technician visited my house and no resolution is more than enough. I will be looking into other alternatives to Comcast unless the problems are fixed immediately."
"Brian of Swoyersville, PA","July 5, 2014",1,"I tried Comcast to save a few bucks, and boy, what a big mistake. All of their set top boxes are heavily used. I should know, I ended up getting nine units because they kept on failing (what A hassle having the technician come to my house to replace these). When watching someone speak on TV, the voice lags behind the lip movement. They told me my TV was too advanced; the frame rate was too high (guess I should have saved my old TV). I noticed that the HD was not as clear as DIRECTV's, and found that Comcast's maximum is 720p, not 1080. Their DVR hardly holds any shows, they told me to get Xfinity, but then I found that all of this Xfinity features were not available in my area, and it would be a extra $20 (so much for saving a few bucks). When you call for a technician to come out and repair the set-top box, watch, because they will try to charge you for this. That was the last straw for me, when they try to charge me a second time for the technician to come out, and they refused to credit me on my bill (even when I talk to the manager, I got nowhere). All of this happened within a span of two months. What a fiasco!"
"don of Portland, OR","June 18, 2014",1,"I was a customer for over 25 years and decided to try it again. Nothing has changed, driver was here at about 1 pm (appointment was set for 12 to 2). He showed up at 1:00 stood by his truck for about 10 minutes and then left. I called Comcast and the driver said he came to my door and knocked, which is a flat out lie because I was working in the front yard. I have 2 dogs in the house that if you even walk up my sidewalk the dogs bark like crazy, ALWAYS. I tried to speak to someone in management, the person on the phone was not going to let that happen. This is worse than when I dropped them a year ago."
"Joie of Visalia, CA","June 17, 2014",1,"I signed up for triple play service, was quoted $109.99 for service and CS would call me back in 24 hrs to set up time to install. 3 calls and 4 days later, was scheduled for set up. When tech arrive he only had information that I was to get double play and had to call in for information. Because the work order was not set up properly, they had to disconnect my phone, give me a new number for 5 days to get the phone transferred. Tech was at my house for 3 hours trying to get issues resolved and just left after it was time for him to go home. I kept getting calls from the company trying to resolve the phone order and found out that they again had me set on another payment of over $188 a month. I talked to the CS and wasted another hour on the phone. Then I got another email stating my payments would be $188, and called back to see what was going on. They went in and checked my account and said on their side they had the correct amount and would notify whoever to straighten it out. Meantime we had television that was spotty and remote, would not change channels properly. I had to elderly aunts that were having a hard time and decided to call in to see what could be done about it. When I talked to CS, they stated that we had the $144 a month program! Now I have had so many people telling me different amounts and still the service was not working correct, so told them that I was going to call them back later cause I was going to cancel their service because of the mess. I told the CS not to cancel until I called back. They terminated the service the next day!!!!!!!! I hate this company. I have a feeling they are going to bill me incorrectly as well."
"Paul of Elk Grove, CA","June 13, 2014",1,"My girlfriend and I switched from an old Comcast box to the new X1 DVR box. It's been one problem after another. I watch NHL playoffs, so the first thing I tried to do was search for games and record them. I used the search function and found that Xfinity had the NHL playoffs listed as a ""TV series"" and had grouped every playoff game into ""episodes"". But not every playoff game showed up under the list of ""episodes"". So if I wanted to record some games, I had to flip through the guide hour by hour, channel by channel, day by day. When trying to record from the listing on the guide, I was only allowed to extend the recording (I always extend recordings of games in case of overtime) by 5 minutes. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. It's a fact that 90% of the use of extending recording is for sports in case of overtime. Approximately 0% of the entire earth's population wants to extend their sports game by 5 minutes. Next, I tried to record game 7 of the NY Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. It appears as ""Stanley Cup Playoffs"" scheduled to air 4-6:30pm. After attempting to record the game, THE TITLE CHANGES to ""NHL Live"" and THE TIME SLOT CHANGES from 4-4:30pm! (And there is no NHL Live show scheduled in the guide). I extend the recording by 1 1/2 hrs and then the title CHANGES BACK to ""Stanley Cup Playoffs"", but the TIME SLOT stays the SAME!! So now, with 1 1/2 hrs extended time... The recording is now set for 4pm-6pm! Since the game is 3 hrs long, I missed the last hour of the game. THIS IS DIRECTLY DUE TO THE X1 XFINITY DVR SYSTEM.NOW.... I try to record Game 6 Chicago vs Minnesota listed for 6-8:30pm via the guide (this ""episode"" was not listed under ""Stanley Cup Playoffs""). I hit record, try to add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (this is the most you can add to the end of an ""episode"" ONLY IF YOU RECORD USING THE SEARCH FUNCTION), but the TITLE CHANGES to ""Shark Tank"" and DOES NOT add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (end of recording remains 8:30pm). Once it hits 8:30pm, the recording stops. So I MANUALLY hit the record button in order to record the remainder of the game. The DVR DOES NOT let me record. I hit the button numerous times with no results. I tried going through the ""INFO"" screen to record and it finally DOES record, but by this time the GAME is on, but the guide says some other show is on and won't let me extend the recording.First, I called the standard customer service number and explained the problems I'd been having. The first guy I reached was VERY quiet and didn't say much of anything. A couple times I thought I lost connection. My hunch was that he was new. It's important to note that during this call, I was watching my favorite team play an NHL playoff game. It's also important to note that at this point, I had ALREADY missed SEVERAL games and ends of games due to Xfinity's poor DVR performance. So after another stretch of dead silence, all of a sudden my TV screen goes black in the middle of the game! I asked him if that was him doing something to the DVR and he said yes. That he had sent a ""signal"" to the box without saying a word to me about what he was going to do... Without asking if this was a good time... Without saying hardly anything at all! I just hung up the phone. Strange thing happened after that ""signal"" was sent... The screensaver now pops up randomly while watching live TV, while watching playbacks of recordings, while watching On Demand movies. So the ""customer service"" rep interrupted my hockey game to add another problem to my DVR box!I decided to call a second time to explain the problems I've been having with the X1 system, including explaining what had happened the last time I called. THIS representative proceeded to tell me how to turn the screensaver function off. As if that was the solution to THEIR problem. It was at this point that I realized that I was getting absolutely NOWHERE with calling ""customer service"". I decided to take more active measures in my quest for customer satisfaction. So I started sending e-mails. First to NBCSN to explain that hockey games are 3 hours long. You would think that since they're a sports network that they WOULD KNOW HOW LONG NHL HOCKEY GAMES LAST. NOT 2 1/2 hours. Not 2 hours. 3 hours!!Second, I began writing emails to Comcast (Xfinity...whatever it's called) to explain that the way the X1 DVR box performs seems thrown together and untested. The IDEA behind the format is a good one, but there are WAY too many ""bugs"" in this system to have released this garbage to the public. I sent an e-mail to Tom **. The reply I got was from someone named ""Risa"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I replied with my account number so that they could more fully research my issues.The second email I got was from someone named ""Lovasie"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 3rd email from someone named ""LaQuinta"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 4th email from someone named ""Betsy"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. Just when I was about to lose my mind... I get a phone call from Stephen ** who arranged to have a tech come out to my house to assess the functionality of my X1 DVR box. He said someone would be out to see me on 6/11/14 in the ""early afternoon"".No one called. No one showed up. I hate Comcast. I despise Xfinity. The only thing worse than their cable is their customer service. I think I may just stop paying my bill and use the X1 box for target practice."
"Kushana of Baltimore, MD","June 10, 2014",1,"Comcast can’t get people service right but they can send out bills that are inaccurate. I just opened this account this May 2, 2014 and I logged in online and my bill is over 382 dollars. I have over a month transcripts of complaints."
"Shawn of Reading, PA","May 30, 2014",1,Had a tech. Supervisor come with reg tech for a long time issue after they left all but one of my five TVs were not working and the Customer service jerk would rather ague with me than send tech. Said that there are NO tech available after telling me that he could if my issue was more serious. If you have a choice DO NOT USE THIS GARBAGE COMPANY! Once again we regular people are victims of MONOPOLY COMPANIES. Just like Airlines. There is your Big Government at work. These Corp. no doubt have to have our leaders in their pocket. Just try and get Good Service and Good Customer Service.
"Mary of Indianapolis, IN","May 21, 2014",2,"I stopped Comcast two years ago because I was promised one price. When the bill came it was much bigger than promised. I called and was told the representative didn't note it down. I told them it needed to be fixed. I didn't owe that amount. After three months of promises not met, I cut off their service. I had my service when they were changing all the digital stuff and they had sent me several boxes to do the switch with. When I cut the service off I returned what I thought was the right box. The customer service lady wouldn't give me a receipt and when I demanded she do so she threw it at me. I tried dealing with them on the bill I didn't owe so contacted the Attorney General's office. I was then contacted by a lady from corporate. She said I didn't owe anything and everything was taken care of. I wanted to make sure I never had to deal with them again so I searched around my house to make sure I had returned everything since they had sent me so many different boxes I didn't need. I did find another box and returned it. They told me it was in their system as stolen (wow the lady from corporate that said all was fine was not being honest). They did take it back and gave me a receipt for it. A few months later I got a letter from a collection agency it had my name and address but someone else's social security number on the letter. I turned it all into the Attorney General's Office and that was that. Now two years later, I got a letter from a collection agency with all my info but the same amount that was on the bogus letter with someone else's social security number, only this time it was mine. I am so sick of these people. No one can get anything straight. You get shuffled around on the phone. They say you owe nothing and will not stop trying to collect. I refuse to pay for someone else's bills. Never chose this company."
"F of New Haven, CT","May 13, 2014",1,"I had no other cable options but Comcast. When I moved again, I was so happy to get rid of Comcast. I canceled the service in October. They have absolutely no record of my cancellation. I continued to be billed and ended up overpaying, because I hadn't realized my service was not canceled. I continued to be billed up to 6 months later. I have spoken to dozen of services representatives and ""supervisors"". Long story short, they owe me $66 and have yet to give me MY money back. I should have been done dealing with Comcast 6 months ago!!!!!!!!!"
"Carol of Mobile, AL","May 10, 2014",1,"My bill jumped $42 in April. I called Comcast to see how I could downgrade my service to lower my bill. I was told I had been overcharged and the new lower amount would be on my May bill. May's bill had not been changed. So I called back and after being connected to 5 different people, the rep. understood the problem and worked with me to get the bill down. After the call, the cable wouldn't work on my main t.v. I once again called Comcast. The rep tried to send a signal to restart the box to no avail. I'm writing this on Saturday and can't get a repair crew out here until next Friday. I refuse to take off work to get quicker service since I didn't cause the problem. The rep did say she would knock off $50 plus off my bill. It's pathetic when you call to change your service and end up with no service at all. This is not the first time I've had with Comcast."
"Patrick of El Sobrante, CA","April 10, 2014",1,"Starting with our bill for February, we noticed over a dozen movies that Comcast claimed we had watched. Most of the movies were pure trash and we would never watch that filth. Calls to Comcast billing got us nowhere as they insisted we had watched all those movies. A visit to the local Comcast office did finally get something done as the rep we spoke with said she would get the movies removed from our bill and also we were provided a PIN number to ensure that no one could watch movies on our account. Guess what? On our March bill 8, more movies had been watched despite having this PIN number to stop that. More calls to the billing department and then passed onto the Tech department. We were told that YES you did watch these movies on your second line and Comcast has the times and dates. The second line is in our guest bedroom which doubles as our home office. The television in that room is only 13 inches while the Main television in our home is in our living room and is 70 inches. What in God's name would we watch movies in an office on a small screen when we have this large television? Did the Comcast rep have an answer? Of course not; he even suggested that someone in the house might have watched these movies without telling anyone. Since it's only my wife and myself and I have out of the country since January that would have been impossible. This rep had the nerve to say that he and his fellow techs had never heard of such a problem and that we must be lying and trying to get out of paying for the movies. That did it. I told this clown that to accuse somebody of lying was beyond the pale and I was filing a formal complaint with the FCC. He quickly changed his tune and insisted that he was not saying we're lying, only that nobody had complained about this happening to them. I told him transfer me back to the department handling cancellations. Finally somebody there realized that I was entitled to these charges being taken off but it would need approval. With that I told her to cancel my entire Comcast service. Without a doubt, Comcast justly deserves the title of worst company in America."
"David  of South Amboy, NJ","April 7, 2014",2,"I've been a customer of Comcast for many years and to be honest I've had my ups and downs with this company. I'm paying $230.00 a month for internet and cable. The wireless internet modem that they provided doesn't even reach the other side of my apartment for one. The biggest complaint I have is that I'm paying $10.00 extra for each premium channel. I wouldn't mind the extra money if they would update their movie list on each channel every month. What they do is they ""expire"" a movie on Starz or HBO only to bring it back on another premium channel. Honestly, what is the point? I'm tired of seeing Mama, Predator, Pitch Perfect and so on continuously repeated. Some movies on Showtime and HBO expire and then return as the new movie. Plus they show the same movie on three different HBO channels like HBO-HD, HBO, HBO-E. This is ridiculous and I hope they are reading this."
"Joseph of Fort Pierce, FL","March 13, 2014",1,"Six or seven months ago we were having random pixelization on our TV screens. It turned out to be a community problem, not just us, that had the problem. Calls to Comcast and visits by techs did not solve the problem. Finally a tech came to the house and did some work in the attic. The problem still not solved after his efforts. Next month I get a bill from Comcast for 88+ dollars. I made a call as was told that the charge would be removed from the bill. It never happened. Subsequent calls bore no fruit. I just kept paying them their monthly Internet charge and no more. A couple of months after the tech's visit, the pixelization disappeared. Today, they cut off my TV and Internet service. I tried to contact Billing but, to no avail. I went down to their Center and they could do nothing. Finally, I got to Billing and stated my case. They filed a case number and said I would have an answer in 24 to 48 hours as to the charge removal. I paid them their, undeserved bill, with the understanding that I would receive a credit but, no guarantee I was told by the originator. What choice do you have when they are the only show in town? They are too big and like the robbers barons of old, need a T.R. to straighten them out. But, we don't need regulation. What a joke! I hope the arbitrator is a Democrat. Monday, I will call to see what happened. Charging me for their problem is not my concern. They have a lousy organization and care little for people - just profit."
"Evgeny of Hanover Park, IL","March 11, 2014",1,"I ordered new internet service with Xfinity Comcast. First of all, the price for the service I picked on their website was $44.99 plus $34.99 for installation. A few hours later,  I received confirmation email with a different price for the service - $54.99 and installation $34.99 Plus they set up an appointment for installer to come, it was 2 hour window between 10 am - noon on Feb 19. I called them to ask about the prices. They said it was a mistake and they corrected the price. Got second confirmation email. They kept the appointment for the same time. I do have copies of those emails. According to their customer policy, if installer comes late, after 2 hour window, they credit my account $25. That day installers came at 12.45 pm, 45 minutes late. At 12.15 pm I called them to find out if the installer is coming. They answered yes, and confirmed that they will give me $25 credit. That day they did not install the service, saying that their cable outside was too low and another line technician should come and fix it first. 2 days later technician came and did nothing, saying that everything is fine and scheduled another appointment for installer. 2 days later another installer came and told me that the cables were too low. He called to the office for line technician to come again. Next day line tech came and told me the same thing, that the cables were fine. I called to Comcast, and they called a local office right away. A few hours later another installer came a finally installed the internet. I called to local office to find out what was going on. A few days later, a supervisor from local office called me and apologized. He told me he looked at my account and said that Comcast waived installation fee and credited $25 for installers coming late first time. About a week later I received bill in mail, and there was no credit or adjustments, plus installation fee was not $34.99, as stated in confirmation email, but it was already $39.99. Called Comcast again, first they told me they will take care of it. 2 days later I could see only that they reduced the bill from $87 to $67, only $20 less. I called again, this time they said they can only reduce installation fee in a half, that was those $20 for. But they cannot issue $25 credit, because they did not have a proof that installer came late. In their system it was showing that I was given appointment window from 8 am to 8 pm, and that I called that day at 12.15 am. And installers came at 11.06 am, which was not true. I told them that I have a copy of email with appointment confirmation from 10 am to noon, and a automatic voice mail reminder from them. They did research, and told me they found a copy of an email that was sent to me and finally agreed to issue me a credit in the next 24-48 hours after my last conversation with them, which was on March 4th, at 10 am. Today is March 7, 10 pm, and no changes on my account have been made. I did record my last conversation with them, when they agreed to give me a credit and have a copy of it."
"Cecil of Sharpsburg, GA","March 8, 2014",1,"Comcast Installation crew installed new cable from Pedestal to pedestal which ran the entire length of my front yard while it was raining. During installation, my sprinkler was broken by Comcast crew and did not repair, and then covered it up. Comcast crews dug in three large areas of my yard chopping my sod in small pieces then back filling holes without packing or leveling. Comcast crews Left Red Georgia clay covering the entire length of curbs where they installed the cable. Comcast did not come close to putting it back to which they found it. If it were a cow pasture it might be appropriate. I've requested these items to be repaired immediately. Waiting for reply."
"Michael of Santa Clara, CA","March 5, 2014",1,"I recently discovered that Comcast erroneously sent an incorrect bill to a collection company under my name and social security number. This erroneous report damaged my credit at a time when I was in the process of purchasing a home. I recently discovered this error and have asked Comcast to send me a copy of the bill that was erroneously established using my information. Since this happened in 2010 the representative I spoke with today, ID **, is stating that she can't pull up this statement even though other Comcast representatives have told me that they can.Comcast is insisting that this was a case of Identity theft and not a mistake of Comcast. I've filed a police report at the advice of Comcast and even the officer taking the report suspects that it was a mistake by Comcast. I feel that I am entitled to receiving the statement that damaged my credit but have tried many ways of getting this without cooperation from Comcast."
"Sandy of Rome, GA","Jan. 23, 2014",1,"I have used Comcast for cable and internet services for many years. I don't know what has happened to their customer service. I had some problems with my bill but took care of it immediately when I discovered it. My cable service was restored within minutes. I kept fooling with my internet but could not get it to work. When my son came home from school, he needed to use the internet for a term paper. I decided to call to see why it had not been restored. Apparently a lot of their customer service employees are offshore. I have never dealt with such rude people in my life. The first agent that I spoke to told me that it was a billing problem. I said no. It has been resolved. I have my confirmation number. He would not reconnect my service, talked over me, raised his voice. I wasn't getting anywhere with him, so I asked to speak to a manager. What's the point in issuing a confirmation number? The manager was worse. He taunted me and said that I needed to speak to someone in the billing department in ""my country."" I just hung up on him. This morning, I called the billing department. No... it was not a problem on their end. My service should have been restored. One department blaming another department. Do they not communicate? The poor customer suffers for their incompetence... and my son couldn't do his term paper. I understand that companies hire offshore employees because it's cheaper labor. Can they not train them in a little customer service etiquette? It was really ridiculous. I'm moving this summer and I think I'll look for alternatives. There has to be someone better than Comcast. Save labor costs.... lose customers. Sorry, Comcast. You suck."
"Anna of Sicklerville, NJ","Jan. 19, 2014",1,"I have been a customer for several years but only noticed the horrible service in the past several months when I actually need to use them. Since I'm always working I was paying for a service I occasionally used but now I rely on the internet to do some work from home. It is now that I noticed how unreliable this service is. The internet only work certain hours a day and when it does the speed goes from 0.1 to 1 or to Mbps or in another words very SLOW although I have been paying for the ""blast"". I have been calling to try to find the issue and they always start with the same annoying questions about rebooting the modem. They have no notes in the system that I have called 300 times for the same problem. Their technical department sent a guy to evaluate the problem and he told me the problem was outside that Comcast was going to send people to fix the outside wire. Guess what? This guy was a ghost because I called 3 days later to check on the process and nobody knew somebody was in my house. There was no ID card nor a service document. Now I'm scare thinking a stranger came to the house and messed with my system. Today I called again since, still have no service since last year and they have no notes of working outside neither. I'm Soooo frustrated specially because my work depends on it. I wish I could switch providers but I have no verizon and I don't know any other providers. I will like to start a petition or an union of anti comcast bullying. Please help."
"Nick of Chelmsford, MA","Jan. 2, 2014",1,"Comcast and the other companies like it have a monopoly in the areas they work in. I don't see how this is right/legal. I canceled my service with Comcast and had an $80 credit on my account, even though I only paid $60 a month for my services! I now have to wait 30 days for them to process my credit and send me a check. So they make us over pay for a service and when we cancel, they make us wait 30 days to issue us a credit. Great policy for Comcast. Bad Customer service and policy for the people they are gouging."
"THOMAS of Manahawkin, NJ","Dec. 14, 2013",1,"Approximately 1 year ago, I decided to cancel my Comcast cable TV and internet service. I switched to DirecTV. After about a year with DirecTV, I became dissatisfied with them and went back to Comcast. I ordered Comcast. It was installed, no problems. After having the service for about a month, with no notice, they disconnected my service. They stated I owed them $675.00. When I called and cancelled my service a year ago and switched to DirecTV, they continued to charge me for months. I canceled over the phone. They stated they have no proof of this as their recorded conversations are only kept for 3 months. This is an outrage and nice scam they inflict on their customers."
"carlton of Phil., PA","Nov. 30, 2013",1,"Since August 26th, I had the service and got the runaround! I was without TV service for Thanksgiving and my kids had to watch movies instead of the parade. They told me to pay my bill and then told me I couldn't get the service in my apartment but installed it! ALSO, they told me that I can only get Wilco Cable but I had Dish Network for 9 years! THE WORST CABLE SERVICE, WELL, I CAN'T CALL IT A SERVICE, EVER!!!!"
"Robert of Crystal Lake, LA","Nov. 10, 2013",1,"Comcast always has an excuse why they do not show up for appointments. Has a service person myself, once the appointment is made with a customer we do not call back to make sure they will be home specially if appointment is made for that same day. If the customer is not home they should get charged for the serviceman showing up. I would rather be charge for missing the appointment from the Service Company than missing a day of work because Comcast said I did not answer the phone from a service tech to keep the appointment.Give me a break Comcast. You're thinking of yourself not your customer. What do they care that it cost the customer to take off work. As long as it does not hurt their bottom line. If there was another (cable company) instead of Comcast I would drop them in a heartbeat. They have cost me too many days of missing work."
"Theresa  of North Charleston, SC","Nov. 7, 2013",1,"1. When you set up the alarm system and ask several times if this is a contract and they say no, DO NO BELIEVE THEM. The alarm system is a piece of garbage. When it goes off, you get no response from Comcast. 2. My home phone has been out since the end of August. They have attempted to correct the problem several times to no avail. They have sent out a tech, told me it was an issue in their office, etc. The phone works for about 24 hours and then nothing. When you call my home, the phone goes straight to voice mail. If you attempt to make a call, you get a busy signal. I wish that my cell phone worked inside my home because I would disconnect this service with quickness. I am now looking for new phone service. Don't even try to call and ask for a supervisor because they are always unavailable."
"Bruce  of Nashua, NH","Oct. 26, 2013",1,We returned a cable modem as we decided to use our own modem and drop the monthly $7.00 fee Comcast charges. We took the equipment to the local service center and did receive a receipt which we currently have. We are still being billed even though we returned the cable modem and have jumped through hoops calling and faxing the receipt to different department. We are still being billed! We are trying to figure out how to resolve this with Comcast and to stop charging us monthly for returned equipment.
"Pat  of Rockford, TN","Oct. 20, 2013",1,"Lately, in the morning hours we do not have access to NBC, ABC and CBS. But, we can get CNN, TWC, etc. What's up with that?"
"Ken of Maysville, GA","Oct. 8, 2013",1,"I have been with Comcast since 09/07/2013 and today is 10/08/2013. In that time I or my wife has called Comcast at least 6 times because all services have been out. We have had 2 technicians to be sent to restore services and that last a few days. We left our previous providers for the services received due to the lower expense. I am beginning to see that you get what you pay for. Just this morning at 4:30 AM, I am on the phone with Comcast trying to get them to send out a signal. I realize that a lot of people must be having the same issues because you hold for over an hour. The company employees needs to realize that the customers pay their salaries and should have a better attitude when you are trying to tell them what is going on with the service and not try to fix the problem with duck tape. Solve the underlying problem and not just get the service up for a few days to pacify the customer because in the long run, the customer gets more irritated."
"Tom of Sarasota, FL","Sept. 15, 2013",1,"Since October 9, 2012 after the 89.99 service, Comcast made disappear my $260 payment (I paid 2 months ahead) which they have promised to find and credit to my account. SINCE MARCH! This still has not happened. On Oct. 15 or about, I received a collection notice for $10!!! For service that I did not ask for, did not want nor did not have. They insisted a $60 installation which also has not been performed because it was a self-installation and I know how to do it. Since I have been receiving bills between $140 there is always plus 8-10 late fee. 3 months ago I canceled cable TV. Still receiving bills for $140-150 although I have paid and overpaid them by my bank's statements that is iron clad. This scheme is an extortion and I am a foreign national and very sensitive for given different terms on services. I have receipts of all my payments and Comcast continues of intentional billing errors towards me. If I get written itemized bill which for the 3rd time I didn't, still turned my internet off although by law they have defaulted seriously. The intent is clear. The lowest internet cost me in Sarasota monthly $87, instead of 39.99 or anyone else's. Yes I have had hours and hours with billing department conversation, which changed my working schedule forever and a derogatory with my boss (private shop, his rules). Comcast broke several consumer laws and they have to pay. Please."
"Thomas of Boothwyn, PA","Sept. 9, 2013",1,Had problems with Comcast suddenly not accepting my bank account checks. They did not inform me of this and then suddenly I had an overdue balance plus the present balance with no internet connection to pay it. Called and talked to someone from India after talking to computer automation for 20 minutes. He said there was a problem accepting the router/bank account number and that the only option was to pay with my credit card. I always paid my bill on time online via my checking account and now it's a problem?? Pay most of my bills this way. Why is it now a problem with Comcast? Think it's time to say goodbye to them since they're always increasing my rate with cable services I don't need. I just want fast internet service and basic cable back to what it was before: about $75.00 to $80.00 a month not $190 to $300 a month!!!
"Frank of Roseville, CA","Sept. 8, 2013",1,"They sent a flyer for Business Internet and Business Voice for only $59.50 per month. I signed up for the plan but when I received my bill I was charged $96.23. After several calls and wasting my time and 3 months later, they still have not fixed the problem. I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST!"
"chi of Houston, TX","Sept. 7, 2013",1,"Don't ever have service with Comcast Cable. They are rip off company. They tell me to sign up with double play for $79 dollars per month and received $200 dollars gift card. But when I sign up with them, they never give me $200 cash back or deduct from my bill. Don't ever sign up with Comcast. I try to solve the problem with them but it never resolved. Moreover, they also overcharged my bill and put on my credit report. Additionally, I already return their equipment, but they told and threaten me to charge the equipment fee. Don't ever sign up with Comcast Cable."
"Karen of Chicago, IL","Aug. 26, 2013",1,"I was just informed that there will be a substantial ""disconnection fee"" and 60 days notice to terminate my service. I have called Comcast twice today only to be put on Hold for 45 minutes each time. I finally reached a representative only to give me that bad news that I wasn't even aware of. She said she would send me the agreement, which is signed electronically.... They NEVER advised me that there was a disconnect fee!!!!!! Small print I guess... The rep said she would send over the paperwork to cancel and she did not!!! I have been all over the website and there is NOT ONE link to do so!!! NOW WHAT?"
"Marc H. of Ann Arbor, MI","Aug. 26, 2013",2,"Comcast is capable of providing decent service to their customers, but not without charging you an arm and a leg for it. Also, they keep raising their prices for nothing and we have to call them every month to dispute the charges, and it's like as if they want to give us the runaround. Why us??? If you ask me, my suggestion for Comcast is to let customers pick exactly what channels they want to have and charge us a reasonable price for it, along with internet and phone. I watch only comedy pretty much, but Comcast loves to throw a lot of channels in that we won't even watch. Who has time to watch all these channels anyways, unless they have nothing better to do with their time?"
"don of Seattle, WA","July 24, 2013",1,"I have been a Comcast customer for years and now I find that Comcast keeps adding new charges to my cable bill. When Comcast changed to digital service a couple of years ago they gave you 2 FREE digital adapters for you other TVs and charged you $1.99 for any more above the first two. Well now they have figured out if you were willing to pay for any above the two free adapters why not charge for every extra digital adapter. When it seems like your cable bill can't get any higher, Comcast will figure out a way to squeeze you for more money.In my area there are 3 other cable companies and I'm sorry I signed a 2 year contract with Comcast guaranteed basic price but what isn't guaranteed is pricing on anything extra which isn't stated in the basic price. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND COMCAST to anyone these days. For years Comcast had a lock on our area but now there is 3 other cable companies so they now have competition. Anyone looking for cable look what the others are offering and their pricing. The service is almost the same BUT the pricing from the others is much cheaper."
"Carter of Warren, OH","June 27, 2013",1,"I took out TV and internet service with Comcast in January 2013 at my Florida location. I explained it would be temporary and paid the full rate (no discounts for contract duration) for the service. On 3/27/13, I returned their equipment to their Leesburg, FL service office, expecting to get a refund for unused time and returning the equipment. To date, I have received a check for $21.07 from a total of $66.07. When I contacted them about the remaining $45.00, I discovered they were keeping that because I supposedly failed to return their equipment.When I returned the equipment to the Leesburg office on 3/27/13, I asked the lady on duty if I could get a receipt showing that I returned the equipment. She informed me that all of the equipment had serial numbers and they would identify when it was returned by the numbers. A couple of weeks after I returned to Ohio, I received a call from a Comcast rep asking when I would return the equipment. I explained that I had and what I was told in the Leesburg office. She assured me she would take care of the issue. Since then it has gone downhill. I used chat (more than once) to discuss the problem. Finally, I had a chat on 5/10/13 with one Melani, who assured me I would receive a check in 3 to 4 weeks. To date, I have not received the $45.00 they owe me. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I did what I was asked and I feel as though I am being treated as a liar or just flat being ignored. I returned their equipment on 3/27/2013. It is now 6/27/13. I think there has been more than sufficient time to return my refund. If I owed them money, would they wait three months to get it?I want someone to contact them about this issue and, if possible, their ratings to be negatively affected because of it. If you are not the agency to do so, please advise with whom I should file this complaint that will take some kind of action with Comcast."
"A of Richmond, VA","June 3, 2013",1,"We had Comcast for both TV and internet. When we signed up for internet originally, we began to have a few problems connecting so we called and were told that they couldn't help us. We'd have to purchase their signature support for a $45 down payment and $5 a month. We did it, but only until we moved. Strangely enough, we never had any further problem after we signed up for the support plan. Recently, we ended the TV part of our plan because we weren't getting the channels included in our plan, and were lied to by Comcast multiple times. They told us they'd recently dropped those channels. The last couple of days, our internet has been going in and out. When I called, they determined that the problem was with the line and not my modem. They scheduled an appointment for a technician to come out and fix it, but then tried to transfer me to their signature support people to sell me the support plan again. What this tells me is that they lost the cable income from me so they are trying to get more money through the support plan by messing with my internet connection, which is inaccessible during the day but not in the evening. Comcast employees will lie, keep you on hold for hours, and try everything to get extra charges coming in each month."
"Brandy of Bethel, DE","May 30, 2013",1,"I have had the absolute worst service imaginable from Comcast's chosen rebate vendor, Saveology. Eighteen weeks have passed and no rebate for my router and modem which were to be ""free"" according to their sales rep when I switched from DirecTV to Comcast. Now, it's going to be another 8 weeks for my check because they're backed up?! No! Ten to sixteen weeks was what was on the form and even that is too long! Saveology simply told me that I would be forced to wait, and Comcast isn't replying via Facebook at all. I plan to continue calling and hounding them. This is poor service at the worst."
"NICOLETTE of Tacoma, WA","May 14, 2013",1,"Timothy, I hear you about your issue with Comcast PNW. They have a monopoly everywhere, but at least in Tacoma, I can switch to a dish provider or Click! Cable. I had the same problem with their Signature Support. I received a benign-looking card in the mail over a month ago and thought it was weird but unfortunately, I didn't call Comcast. I just thought they were rolling out some new type of service and were trying to get me to sign up. Boy, was I wrong! Later that month, I received my bill and to my surprise, there was a $14.95 charge + $4.98 partial month charge for something called Signature Support, as of early April. I did not ever, ever sign up for that crap. I tried calling but hold time was ridiculously long! I tried calling customer service, emailing, chatting online, etc. and every time, they’re like, ""You need to call Signature Support."" Some help!This costs $15/month? Anyways, things came up and next thing you know, it's my next billing cycle and I'm reminded of the charges again. I called and waited 30 minutes. I finally got through to a foreign call center and asked for this service to be removed and the charges credited, since I never asked for it. The rep said she won't be to do that for me. She's so sorry but it's been over 30 days since and said that I added it. Did she not just hear me say I didn't add it and that I have no idea why it's on there? How can Comcast add a service without my consent and not refund the charges because I didn't call back in time? In the 5+ years since I've been a Comcast customer, I have needed their help with a service issue once. That's it! I asked her if she could please play the recorded call in which I (or someone authorized, like my husband) asked for this service and agreed to the charges. She put me on hold for a few minutes, came back and said they don't have it. So, no concrete proof exists with me or my husband asking for this new monthly service charge to be added to the account? Unreal! At that point, the rep began her stonewall routine, so I asked for a supervisor. She sent me over after another 10 minute hold and I'm greeted to broken English along with an amazing amount of buzzing, ringing, whizzing and static on the line (not me, btw), not to mention the same old routine of talking over me, telling me they understand, putting me on hold, etc. I got all the info I could get about the supposed call in which these service were added, like the date, time, rep I spoke with. They, of course, couldn't tell me who called in. But I'm sorry, without real proof of this call like a recording, the charges need to be credited. I made that clear but they had to escalate my issue and I'll be hearing back (meaning I'll receive a call) within the next 48 hours. Unbelievable that I would be treated so poorly after being a loyal Comcast customer for this long! Inexcusable! I can make no other conclusion here but that Comcast is crooked and they are deliberately signing people up for this junk without asking so that they can make a few extra bucks. Blegh! It makes me sick. "
"Connie of Stockton, CA","May 11, 2013",1,"On Tuesday, May 7, 2013 at 6:00 pm, my TV Comcast froze on ""One Moment Please."" After waiting 15 minutes, I made an attempt to call Comcast with a 15-minute wait time. The agent that I was finally connected with had me try several ways of resolving the problem to no avail. She indicated that my box would probably need to be swapped out and set me up with a Thursday appointment, between 8-10 am. She also told me to unplug the TV and that a technician would be calling me back in 45 minutes. After waiting 1 hour 15 minutes, I called Comcast back with another 15-minute wait before I was connected with an agent in South America. She had me jump through the same hoops as the first agent and after being asked for the last four numbers of my SS#, I said I needed to speak with an agent in the US. After another long wait, I was connected to an agent in the Philippines. She started the whole process again and after having her repeat the same instructions over and over, I told her I could not do this anymore (it was now 10:00pm!) and I hung up. Knowing I had a Thursday morning appointment, I decided to wait until then. Thursday morning, I called to confirm the appointment and was told that I did not have an appointment! The agent then again tried to correct the problem to no avail and scheduled an appointment for Friday, May 10 between 4-6 pm. Again, I called that day at 4:45 pm to confirm and that agent insisted on trying to resolve the issue by phone. The technician then called and arrived to correct the problem. He left my residence at approximately 7:00 pm on Friday evening. At 9:59 am Saturday morning, my TV again froze showing ""One Moment Please."" I called Comcast at 10:15am and it was 1/2 hour before I could get through again being connected to the Philippines! I immediately asked to be connected to an agent in the US because the line was static and I could not understand the agent. She wanted all my personal information and after providing this, she still wanted the last four of my SS# which I refused to provide. She then put me on hold and another agent after a 1/2 hour wait answered the phone and when asked, indicated he too was located in the Philippines. Then he told me that he is not in the department I need and another agent from the Philippines took the call. It is now 11:00 am and she assured me that a technician will be calling me back in 30 minutes! So far, I have been without a TV for 78 hours and have been on the phone for approximately 8 hours trying to resolve this problem."
"Carrie of Richmond, VA","April 27, 2013",1,"Comcast has been over to my house for over 15 times to correct issues (all while me waiting for 4 hours at a time for a servicer to come for cable, internet and phone service, unpaid). I have even contacted the corporate office in the past. I called 3 weeks ago to advise that I was switching to Verizon due to them charging me $150.00 on my bill, yet they advertise $89.00 for all three package on TV. The lady I spoke to advised that she was reducing my bill back down to $99.00 for all three and sending me a free DVR for a year at no charge with free HBO for 3 months. When I got my bill, they did charge me for DVR and still over $150.00. 3 weeks later, my DVR is not working and either is my cable. When I called, they advised the DVR is broken and they want to send out a technician on Monday. I work and am missing pay for every time they have had to come out here. When I asked for a corporate number, Anne Marie (the manager) advised that she did not know it. She advised that she would have her supervisor contact me back, but couldn't give me their name or number. So I am being charged still over $150.00 a month with a broken service and being charged for services I was told were free, and that they wouldn't charge me anything besides $99.00 for everything. I am still sitting here with a broken equipment that doesn't work and a bill that is overcharged without a resolution. When I googled the corporate number, they advised that the office was closed? This company is a bait and switch. To bring broken equipment about ten times to my house, as well as overcharge me and not reimburse me for the time taken off work for me to wait for their service techs, I should be reimbursed for everything! $100.00 at lowest for every time they have come out here for me to miss pay is $1,500.00. That is a year's service for free!"
"Debra of Kearneysville, WV","April 26, 2013",1,"I returned a converter box with superficial damage to the plastic cover of the box (it warped from heat in an entertainment center). They did say I would have to pay for the damage, which I am okay with but on my next bill, it showed as ""unreturned equipment"" for $300! If I had known I would be charged for the entire box, I would have just kept it. The receipt I signed distinctly says, ""If any charge is listed above by signing this receipt, I understand the charge will be added to my account and I am legally liable to pay the charge listed above."" There was no charge listed on the receipt! Apparently, they do not know what the word ""If"" means. After two months of dealing with multiple customer service avenues, this has still not been resolved. Lesson learned: When you return any equipment to Comcast, make sure you take a picture of it; find out what the possible charge may be and keep the equipment until you have reached an agreement."
"Dale of Newman, CA","April 20, 2013",1,"I just found out that Comcast does not supply the battery backup for phone modem but they do not let you know that until you call in and ask where the battery is. I called and asked what if the power goes out. They said that you have to buy the battery for $35. I told them that they should let customers know this because I am disabled and need my phone. I was told, ""Too bad, buy the battery."" The modem they took out and replaced had a battery. I ordered my new modem for the new speed they told me about and needed a new modem so they replaced it. I think that Comcast should notify their customers about this. There are a lot of disabled people out there that need a phone 24 hours a day."
"Judith of Shelton, WA","April 13, 2013",1,"I received a notice that my cable signal had an issue and I needed to set up appointment to be home when they came to fix. First appointment was for Apr. 3 between 1 and 3 pm. 3:30 I called to ask when I could expect tech and was informed he could not tell me that, just would be sometime today. I cancelled and rescheduled for April 9th between 8am and 10am and requested if possible to be the first appt. Noon came, no phone call, no repairman, no contact to this day. Cable still making little squares in signal. You are spending a lot of effort on TV to convince people to make 2 hr window appointments. What hogwash! Am I ever going to get problem fixed?"
"Lawrence of Atlanta, GA","March 29, 2013",1,"Watchathon free HBO was not honored - it's a scam to make you upgrade for 6 months. I had 2 days of HBO. When asked why I received a message about the upgrade for free week I had not received, there was no answer back. I asked to remove Free Watchathon and was told $2.99 would be billed for a service change? Is this a scam to get upgrade deal you did not request? Watch out for a real shady deal!"
"Dana  of Aurora, IN","Feb. 27, 2013",1,"I have had Comcast service for about a month and a half now and have had trouble with them from day one. The person they sent to hook it up was in such a hurry he left his computer and phone in my home. On the second day of service, the TV started tiling and I had to call and report that. The internet modem keeps resetting at random and the speeds have never been at what I am paying for.Now to the billing scam ... I paid my first bill just fine, but on my second bill, Comcast lied and said that my bank refused to pay it to them. My bank has never refused a payment. So I called the bank and they said they did okay the payment and told me to call Comcast back and have them try again. I called Comcast back and they told me they would not try again and I had no choice but to resubmit another payment. Then they promised me I would not be billed twice in the same month. I was wary about that and did not want to do that, but I was assured they would not double dip my bank account and cause me to go negative in my bank account. So I agreed to resubmit after they assured me 3 different times they would not charge me twice. Now, 15 days had passed, and I thought all had gone well, until I went to the store and my bank card would not work due to insufficient funds. So I came home and looked at my bank account and, sure enough, they had taken another payment out 15 days later for the same month's bill. I called and they flat out said that I was lying and that they did not take that money out of my Bank. They were trying to hide it on their end and someone was trying to pocket the money. I told them that it showed on my statement and they still said I was lying and I needed to go to a service office to show them my bank statement before they would believe me. Well, they closed the local office so I had to drive an hour and a half to a service office to prove that they took unauthorized money out of my bank. They were hoping I would just be lazy and blow it off.I got to the office and then the lady put a ticket in to refund my money after she had seen and could not deny that the funds were withdrawn. I sill have not received that refund as of today. I am still waiting. They never even offered me so much as an apology for stealing the money and costing me an overage fee, calling me a liar and making me drive 3 hours just to prove I was right. Comcast has the most rude, corrupt employees I have ever dealt with in my life.I will be dropping their service as soon as the 28th when I get hooked up from another business that I know will do right by their consumers. There is no way I would ever stay with a company that treats their customers so poorly and tries to rob them of extra money."
"Ben  of Cromwell, CT","Feb. 26, 2013",1,"My Comcast experience so far: I ordered services to be installed in Feb. 2013. Comcast never showed up for the appt or called. I contacted them a week later and they indicated a glitch in the system had prevented the original order from processing. After rescheduling, the technician showed up with the wrong order information. After straightening out the order details, the tech installed my HDTV DVR and an old HD secondary box, which wasn't HDMI capable. Later that evening, the HD DVR broke and the tech advised me to go pick up a replacement box. I picked up the new boxes only to find out they gave me the wrong remotes, so I contacted the tech and they helped me through reprogramming the remote to work with the new boxes. I think finally the equipment is working; the nightmare is over. Nope, my bill is way off from the original pricing. The install fee was off by $7 and a equipment fee was on my bill for the second HD box that I was originally told would be included at no extra cost. On top of all this, the service tech had replaced my cable modem with a dual cable phone modem, but had taken my original cable modem, which is my property. I'm still trying to get this back. Horrible experience!"
"Todd of Carlisle, PA","Feb. 17, 2013",1,Comcast sends an email bill directly to my inbox indicating the current amount owed was $117.13. The amount currently owed in their online detailed account information was $73.45. The amount currently owed when calling the automated phone service was $103.10. At the top of their online account information page was another amount stating that $109.18 was due in order to prevent service interruption. A formal complaint was filed with the Better Business Bureau and with the Attorney General's Office. Nothing short of a class action suit will get their attention.
"Roger of Waynesboro, VA","Feb. 15, 2013",1,"I had a Comcast representative visit my home in December 2012 and presented to us a bundle for cable, internet and home phone for a set price that was supposed to not change each month. 2 months later and we have not yet paid the set price. It is always more and every time that I call and speak to the help desk, I am told something different or that is not the correct amount."
"Denis of Fort Myers Beach, FL","Jan. 31, 2013",1,"I got a monthly bill that was $12.72 higher than the month before (from $147.65 to $160.37) without any increase in services or any notification that this was happening, or why it was happening. I called (239) 432-9277 and was eventually connected to Ashley. I asked why the rates were increased and was told that, basically there was a new year beginning and the company increased the cost of some services (it was all of the services to which I subscribe) - an increase of $3.00 for digital starter, an increase of $1.00 for HD/HDR Service, an increase of $3.98 for Digital Adaptor Service (Last year, Comcast required that everyone get a special ""little"" channel selector for any television that we wished to get any channel beyond channel 13. You got two for free and paid for any additional adaptor.Now those two free adaptors are being billed $1.99 each per month... and if you don't pay, you only get channels 2-13 on those televisions), and to round things off, our internet service, for which we pay more, to get better service (which is really terrible on Fort Myers Beach to begin), has gone up $3.00 monthly. Ashley indicated that we had not been notified of any increase prior to the increase. The supervisor was not available to take a call, but I could leave a message and probably get a call back. I left a message, but asked not to be called back unless my bill was going to be the same as before. This company is taking advantage of its customer base. One should not have to go through the aggravation of changing providers simply to get good service at a reasonable price. I believe that is what the company is relying on... that a customer won't go through the aggravation to change vendors just to save $12.72 per month."
"Eliezer of Berkeley Heights, NJ","Feb. 7, 2016",1,"After two years with Verizon, I've returned to Comcast to completely different experience. They were ready to offer inexpensive stand-alone Internet with no contract and obligations.  They sent me a self-installation kit (I had already had the wiring) for just 10 dollars, and they did not try to put hidden fees.  I have had their service for 2 months now to my complete satisfaction.  (I am one of so-called ""cable cutters"": I have The Internet from Comcast, phone from Magic Jack that is almost free and the news and entertainment from Roku, Amazon and Sling.)Original ReviewComcast bombed me with advertising about their triple play for $79.99 a month for 12 months and eventually, I agreed which started on Dec. 12, 2012. It was a complete fraud. They sent me maybe 10 e-mails that my rate is $99.99. After at least a dozen phone calls, agent-supervisor Sharon (ID **) sent me a letter dated Dec. 19, 2012, with a detailed description of my charges. It was satisfactory, the first bill was in accordance with her letter and I thought that the problem was settled. I was naive!On Jan. 8, 2013, I received an unsigned letter that they erred in billing me and starting the next month, my bill will go up from $106 to $115.95! I have never accepted even the $106 charge! I called to the Comcast headquarters in Philadelphia. A person named Chuck returned me a call and tried to convince me that because they gave me a $25 credit, my $116 - $25 = $91 still be good and I need to be happy even though I signed for $79.99. The issue has been unresolved.I am 75 years old and I may get heart attack from all these dealings. Just do not trust them and do not sign up with Comcast."
"Donovan of Irvington, NJ","Jan. 13, 2013",1,"I scheduled a service appointment for 7 to 9 am at my address in NJ. At 9:16 am, I called Comcast and was informed by the agent he was held up but on his way shortly. At 11:25 am, I called back to say it was a no show. Agent looked at the notes and said the tech said he came and no one was home. Really? I didn't know I was a magician that could be in 2 places at once. He is a blasted liar. He never called. Furthermore, how he could have missed the car in the driveway you have to pass to get to my door is beyond me. It's just poor, distasteful customer service."
"Jacqueline of Cotati, CA","Jan. 7, 2013",1,"Nine phone calls to Comcast about a simple connection issue with e-mail. Each time, I had to call a technician at 1-800-266-2278 number, which is the only number provided on the billing or website. Tech was not able to help. After being on-hold for over 40 minutes, the tech disconnected me and I had to start over. Person who stated he was no longer a tech tried to help but was unable to. I was 36 minutes on hold prior to speaking with him. Tech changed password on account but we still could not access on our end. He gave us the number that we can call him on to get assistance. (I had to start again.)I told Comcast to send a tech to my home after getting the complete runaround for hours. Scheduled appointment for the next day is between 2-4pm. The Comcast call center called to make sure we were here which we were, but then they never showed up. But we got a call from Comcast asking how the tech was. I called to complain that no one showed up. Employee stated they would be out and would call in an hour. No call, no show. I called back and found out that she had rescheduled for someone to come out the next day at 12-2pm but never notified us. The supervisor stated would have a person out at 0730H tomorrow, as no one is available today.We have had Comcast over 20 years. I spent over 7 hours on hold or waiting around the house for a tech to show up. No one could help me or show up to fix the problem or even have the decency to call back (or show up) to tell me what they plan to do to fix the problem. Companies who bill you over $100 a month for their service should have a better customer service plan in place and not have customers stay on a phone line on an average of 30+ minutes prior to speaking to someone. This is the first time I have ever written in a review about anything! It's truly unbelievable how poorly this company runs."
"Rachel of Belleville, MI","Jan. 4, 2013",1,"Xfinity is a very poorly-run company in every aspect. Their Tech Support and customer service reps are generally uninformed, unskilled, and have a hard time understanding your issue and/or English. Their phone menus are laborious and rarely connect you to the proper department. If you disconnect service and need to return equipment, make sure you have the correct address. Their databases have different information and are not synched correctly, so you could end up making a trip to an empty office. If you actually end up finding an Xfinity location, make sure you have at least 2 hours to spare and don't forget to take a number and pay attention while you wait. I was there for three hours, and was given two location addresses that no longer existed before finding one. Thus, to return equipment, it took approximately five hours and 2 gallons of gas. The biggest complaint I have concerning Comcast/Xfinity is their lack of diligence and problem solving in regards to security breaches. Someone obtained a false account in my name. I had an existing legitimate account at the time, and had called many times for various issues. Never once was I informed of the other account, nor was I contacted when it went to collections. It showed up when I did a random credit check. It took several techs and at least an hour before they could even find the phony account, and then they were supposed to send an identity theft kit. Three requests to three different customer techs later, it still hasn't arrived."
"venessa of Lake Wales, FL","Dec. 18, 2012",1,"I have had the absolute worst service since day one of installation. I was charged for installation for additional outlets that were never installed and not needed since I already had the outlets. Then I was seriously overcharged on my first bill and when I called, after being on hold forever and transferred around ten times, I was greeted by the rudest person in the world. I was assured I would be credited and eventually was after several months and, in the meantime, I was having my service interrupted several times for no reason and, of course, scammed and charged reconnect fees. Now today, my service was interrupted again for a twenty-nine-dollar bill. Please keep in mind, I just got the bill last night which said the bill was due the same day I got it in the mail. Now, of course, I'm going to be charged another reconnect fee. I wish there was another cable company in my area. I never had any problems when I had Bright House and only hope and pray one day soon they service my area. I hate Comcast. I wish someone would investigate their business practices because Comcast is the biggest scam company in the world. Not to mention my internet has not worked right since day one and I never got credited for non-working service but they have no problem charging me their BS fees."
"Bonnie   of Minnetonka, MN","Nov. 30, 2012",1,"On November 29, I called Comcast to report very slow, at times no internet service. I spoke with tech named John, who was not in MN. I was on the phone for at least 30 minutes, while he attempted to reconnect service. I also asked him to record my complaint as we have had problems with service previously. He asked that I hang as he would make further efforts to fix the problem and he would call me back. No call. November 30 is my second call to Comcast. I spoke with Cricket, who said there was no record of my call the previous day. She took information and said she would schedule a tech to call me for an appointment. The tech called and her first words were, ""I can tell you why you are having trouble. You have a mechanical problem, weak signal."" I am no techie but could figure that out. She explained that this can be determined at their end but there is no way to contact Comcast locally, only through the call center. How brilliant for a company to combine inefficiency with lousy customer service. She scheduled an appointment for 8-10 Friday. Subsequently, we got a notice that it was for the same time, but Monday. Next is an automated phone call for a tech to come 4-6 pm Friday. Hopefully, someone will appear sometime."
"Richard of El Dorado Hills, CA","Nov. 22, 2012",1,"Although I do not have a Service Agreement with Comcast, most of the tenants in my 12 unit apartment building do. One of the tenants was not getting the speed he had been promised so he had a technician come out on two separate occasions and they came to the conclusion that more Comcast lines into the building were necessary, but the owner's permission was needed. Thinking that I, as the owner, should take responsibility for the servicing of this, I took a day off work and made an appointment for a technician to meet me there at 10 am, Wednesday. I gave the CSR on the phone my cell phone number and asked that the technician call that number rather than my tenants' number.Now it's 12:30 on Wednesday - no technician, no call and my tenant rolled up and told me that Comcast called his phone (not mine) at 10 am and cancelled the appointment. The two of us called Comcast and asked them that since I took the day off work, spent a couple hours waiting and drove 30 minutes to get there, if they could still send a technician out that day. We were promised that a tech would come before 4 pm (Ticket #** on Nov. 21, 2012). I waited. At 4:30, no technician, no call. I called Comcast and it was strange. She would not acknowledge or deny my Ticket # but she repeatedly ignored whatever I said about my missed second appointment and just told me that Comcast had cancelled my first appointment that morning. Just like our second appointment had never happened. Now it has been 6 1/2 hours of waiting in a parking lot for me, not wanting to miss them. She assured me that she would then send out another technician who would call me in 15 minutes. One hour later, no technician, no call. I called back and she ignored me when I told her that I was waiting for a third time. Finally she admitted to me that she has no record of it, just the first appointment cancelled that morning and that the technicians were now done for the day. It is now 6 pm. I took the day off work (non paid), drove one hour and waited 8 hours in an apartment building parking lot for nothing. Combined, the tenants pay Comcast $400 - $500 per month and Comcast could care less. I felt completely disrespected and lied to, tired of being on the phone for close to 2 hours with numerous CSR's from Comcast that did not even seem to be connected to the company. One gentleman could find no information for 20 minutes when the next woman that I spoke with pulled it up in 30 seconds. I was repeatedly ignored when I asked why no one showed up both times when promised. I guess their policy is that when asked a real question, just do not answer. No one to pay the consequences because no one cares. Sadly, just ineptness and dishonesty. I have no choice but to make another appointment for my tenants' sake. Comcast, if you cared, you would be ashamed of yourself. But you don't care. Everyone else cares but you. Shame on you."
"Carol  of Houston, TX","Nov. 20, 2012",1,"We have been customers of yours since before digital boxes and two weeks ago, we requested move of service and we wanted to add phone and were told no problem, TV would start on the 19th and then phone on the 24th, just move the boxes and they would work. So Friday was the hook up and nothing. We called; ""Okay, would send signal, could see site,"" is what we were told. There was nothing, on Saturday, we called, spent 4 hours on the cellphone plus 4 hours of moving time. There was no answer other than that because we added a phone, it was not started. We told them to cancel phone service and that did not happen. So Sunday still waiting, we called again - 4 hours playing phone tag, same issue, no service, and no one paying for my minutes or time. On Monday, I called starting at 4:30, called every 15 min. There is no TV. As far as I can tell, we have been lied to for 3 weeks that we would move smoothly with no service interruption, but yet your company cannot tell me why they lied when we can move TV, as your voice message says, in two days and add phone. But for 4 days I have no TV or phone? Yet I pay for service, good question in fair business! By the way, no one will send confirmation email?"
"Mary Anne of North Riverside, IL","Nov. 12, 2012",1,"For the bill that is due this month, I found Playboy charges that were not purchased or requested. They are insisting that someone is doing this at my house. I also noticed there is no way to prove this unless we have different purchase pins and the company is unable to provide that capability. Odd in this day and age isn't it? The last time it happened (I've not been charged for this one yet), I was the only one home along with 3 very lazy dogs. I did not order the movies. They agreed to a credit back on October 19 and now they are denying they gave me one. No one seems to admit to these long conversations I have with these people, and what was discussed and what happened. It happened last February too and they admitted it was their problem. We got charged anyway and then they took it off. It happened last year some time, I think it was in the summer. We seem to have a pattern of once we order a regular movie, within a month we start seeing Playboy charges? Comcast has problems and if I order something, I expect to pay for it. There are no perverts, porn addicts or others in my household that would feel it necessary to lie. I think that Comcast is lying or my next door neighbor is hacking my system. Don't get Comcast. I never have these problems with a satellite dish. I have gone back to a service that offers TV via satellite."
"David of Aurora, CO","Nov. 2, 2012",1,"Comcast advertises a paperless bill and the ability to view an itemized bill online. On October 1st, I attempted to access this bill to verify my account, because I thought the bill was off by more than $120. When I attempted to access my bill online, it was not made available to me. When I then went to the FAQ section on their website, it showed the process of a questioning customer from only 3 weeks earlier asking the same question about viewing the itemized bill. After the Comcast rep responded, that same client then re-posted saying that the solution offered did not work. The rep then said in the response that some accounts cannot see the itemized bill.I then attempted to resolve this with the chat representative and they were unable to identify and fix the problem. I then went on to talk to a representative on the phone after they told me of the charges. When I told them those charges weren't accurate, they offered to place credits on my account, but refused to place them on my account until I paid the full amount, which included the $120 worth of extra fees that I should have been charged for in the first place. I was then connected to another two representatives before I was finally able to get resolution to this issue. At this point, I ended up being on the phone for 90 minutes.About 10 days later, I called them again about being able to view my itemized bill. After going through two agents and 30 minutes later (and after supplying them the account number, my Social Security number and verifying my address and phone number), they were still unable to provide me access to view my itemized bill. It frustrates me that I have to get a mailed bill, some four days after the printing, to find out the breakdown on my account. I recommend to anyone to find another way to fulfill your entertainment desires. If I had another option, something that is much cheaper than the Comcast option, I would certainly utilize that.I have also contacted Comcast through the ""Contact Us"" functions and emailed their Customer Support specialist, Rick **, without any response. Thanks for being incompetent, Comcast."
"Matthew of Manchester, NH","Sept. 25, 2012",1,"I made a payment over half of my bill. The new charges are not due for another week and a half and without any late notice sent to me, I have already had my service turned off and back on. Now, I can't order any program on demand. I called the service reps and was told not only could I not order on demand, but also that my screen was gonna be blank any time today - with no notice and still time before my next billing cycle. This is almost like bullying. I’ve been a paying customer for a year now and I feel betrayed by Comcast’s sharking techniques."
"Roger of Katy, TX","Sept. 1, 2012",1,"I changed from AT&T to Comcast on Sunday, August 26, 2012. The technician was not able to get my television to work. He told me that a satellite was down and it would be about 2 hours, and the TV would just come on. He gave me a number to call if there were any problems. Of course, the TV never came on. And when I called the number, it was a recording giving details about employment with Comcast. I called the Comcast official number and got no results. After 8 calls, of which all Comcast representatives said they would call me back and never did, a representative finally scheduled a service call for Friday, August 31 from 4-6 PM. No one showed. I called Comcast back, and the representative told me that my appointment had been cancelled. Not true! However, she did reschedule another service call for Saturday, September 1. Again, no one showed. I called again and again. I was told my service call had been cancelled, even though I have two emails confirming the service call and times. It has been 6 days, and I still have no television. I had some problems with AT&T U-verse and thought Comcast would be better. Wrong! Thank God, I have not yet cancelled my AT&T U-verse account. Even with their problems, they are far better than Comcast. Incidentally, when I told Comcast I would cancel my new account, the attitude was nonchalant - I suppose Comcast does not appreciate its customers. Do not get Comcast XFINITY!"
"Selea of Las Cruces, NM","Aug. 9, 2012",1,"I am one month behind and Comcast has been calling me many times daily. I have spoken to their 1-800 number and have made arrangements.

"Connie of Seattle, WA","July 12, 2012",1,"When installing someone else's lines down the street, Comcast completely cut our lines at my business (telephone, credit card and internet!) for almost three hours in the middle of our business day! We could not take credit cards, use the phone or use the internet during that time. We lost customers who came in and only had credit cards to pay with (we couldn't serve them because we couldn't process their credit cards!).I've been calling and emailing back and forth with George ** since May 5th. He's been promising to help me get a refund for lost sales on that day but nothing has transpired. I'm going to stop my account with them, but they owe us for lost sales and service interruption for those hours! I have copies of the service work order which initially gave the go ahead for them to do the work in the middle of the day (George ** told me it's typically done in the middle of the night so nobody's service is cut). I have copies of all emails between George ** and myself. He has quit returning calls and emails."
"Karen  of Nashville, TN","July 2, 2012",2,"Upon services provided on 6/7/12, tech arrived very late. He hooked up my service but had to call 4 days later because I could not receive all channels. At this time, $20 was taken off my bill because he was late. A second tech came out and was also late. He replaced the line going to the receivers. All lines worked for about 10 days only. Another $20 was credited to my account. On 6/30/12 another tech came out who was also late. An additional $20 was credited to my account. At this visit the lines were replaced from the house to the pole on the street. At this time, services are working properly thanks to tech #**. I am requesting 1 month credit on my bill due to the fact that I did not have full services available."
"Sunshine of Oakland, CA","June 30, 2012",1,"I don't like Comcast telling me I gotta pay my bill a month in advance! I've got 5 kids and my baby, Daddy, don't got no job! We just bought a 60"" plasma and the ** at Comcast, Hector ""I don't speak English so good"", told me I was in ""soft disco"" and I had like 3 weeks to pay before they sent a guy out to shut me off at my house! Hector told me I was still getting billed and it's because during this time they don't charge you like $50 to turn your service back on like PGE does. This is totally wrong!This is the 4th time this year they did this to my babies. I asked if I could pay $20 of the $379 I owe so they could put it back on for a day and the guy was so rude and didn't care that my family needs to watch TV and go on the computer to watch cartoons and stuff. I told him to give me a manager and he was like so rude and said he would get me one, but then this guy in Sales picked up and had no clue that Hector was talking to me! So, the sales guy wouldn't do anything except tell me that tomorrow I will be shut off for nonpayment and if I want it back on, I have to pay the past due, a reconnect charge and I have to pay one month in advance to show I mean to pay them on time!He didn't want to talk to me so he did get me a mgr, but the mgr didn't act like they cared! I told her about how I don't have money now b/c we had to buy a new TV and Blu-ray and why should I have to pay them so much? She told me maybe I should give up my premieres like HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax and Stars and my 4 DVRs. That is **! She told me I could add a phone to get a better deal on a promotion, but I don't need their ** phone. I got 3 smartphones and what's up with that?Comcast acts like b/c I'm on family assistance, I have to give up my TVs and lifestyle! They won't even let me order PPV and fights for my daddy b/c they say I don't pay my bill on time! Omg, they made me put this number on my TV so ""nobody can order movies if I don't want!"" It doesn't work. They keep adding porns to my bill and saying we are doing it. Liars, you're going to burn in hell! Last month, they said I had like 15 movies at $15 each! They said what time they were ordered and I was out shopping and there is no way my kids would order that!Oh, and the mgr. lady thought she had me on hold and I heard her tell somebody that she got another one of those people from Oakland and just what is wrong with people from Oakland, Stockton, and Fresno that they don't pay their bills and want a free hand out! I called my people at NAACP and filed a complaint! Have a blessed day!"
"Cherilynn of New Hudson, MI","June 23, 2012",1,"I can't even begin to describe what I have gone through with this company. Since day one, they have been like a Hollywood movie. The stuff they have put me through is unbelievable. At certain points in time, I document what goes on. What makes this really sad is I am disabled and really need service not only for cognitive help, but for safety reasons too. This last episode going on since May 22, 2012 has to be bordering on illegal and defiantly discriminating.Comcast is charging me $149 per month for no service. In the last year, a dozen or so managers were supposed to call me back. It didn't happen. When I do get supervisors/managers, they say they are going to help me, never to hear from them again and their phone number is soon disconnected. Comcast's catastrophic problem phone line doesn't answer. They are so messed up I hear you never get the same answer twice. Even when you talk to a dozen Comcast employees in one day, they never give you the same answer. My modem has been changed over 6 times. I could go on and on of what they have done to me but it's useless and overwhelming. In three weeks, I was on the phone with Comcast 1378 minutes on my cellphone and had to buy more minutes to talk to them. In addition, there were four techs on as many different days in my house with obnoxious customer service skills. This has to be the worst company ever and consumers cannot do anything about them. It seems like the FCC or local governments get so much lobbying money from Comcast, there is not help anywhere. Give me regulated Ma Bell back!"
"Bobbi of Exeter, NH","May 23, 2012",2,"I am not sure who will ever read this. I was compelled to write about my frustration. I am a 50 year old divorced woman living in Exeter, NH. Comcast is our local cable provider. Three years ago, I was divorced from my husband of 23 years. He left the area (in haste) moving to Arkansas. Unbeknownst to me the cable services were in his name. The reason I was not aware of this was because I went to the cable company and they changed the bill to my name and never informed me that the account was in his name. The problem came this January when I went to reduce my services to just internet. I was informed that I could not reduce services because he had moved back to the area and had services at his new home as well as my residence in his name. Also, I was informed that he had full access to my phone records as well as my emails through Comcast. This was very disheartening because I have an order of protection that was granted during the divorce, which I had previously taken into the Exeter, NH office and showed the office staff. The result of this was changing the bill to my name yet keeping the account in his name. I was not informed of this and always felt that I was the owner of the account. After calling Comcast numerous times (the number was from the bill), I was informed that I could not even have a repairman come to my home to service the cable I was paying for. This was ironic because I have had repairmen out at least 4 times for problems dealing with the phone and computer services. So, since January of this year, I have personally entered the office seeking help. I now know where my ex-husband was getting information on me which your company allowed him. I am very frustrated that I (as the person paying the bill) was never informed that he had access to my account. This frustration only multiplied in the fact no one would let me disconnect the services. My only option was to allow the account to go into default. On Monday evening of this week, I again called Comcast. The difference was this time I raised my voice, swore and cried out of anger. This time, I finally got results. Why is it that you need to raise your voice and act like a lunatic for this company to listen? Being polite and courteous seemed to lead me to a brick wall. I could no longer stand for everyone knowing my business served on a platter catered by Comcast. I had to pay the back bills (even though I did not utilize the services nor wanted them). But if it brought me freedom from this mess, so be it! This morning the Comcast office in Exeter, NH called me (after dealing with me every day trying to turn off my services) to ask when I wanted to have my services turned on! Seriously!"
"Donna  of Elmwood, TN","May 6, 2012",1,"I ordered Comcast Cable from a very nice representative, who set me up with an appointment the next morning between 8am and 10am. I told him I had to work that day, but that my mother lives with me and would be there all day. He said that was fine. I received a courtesy call confirming the appointment and that someone over 18 had to be there.The next morning about 9am, my mother called and said that the man had come and said I had to be there or he wouldn't hook up the cable. She said he was grumbling about other jobs he had to do. I called Comcast about the trouble and what the man had said and done. All the representatives apologized, but they did nothing but either said that all the workers were busy taking care of other customers until Monday or that they would send somebody out. But nobody came. This went on from about 9am to well after 4 pm and at least 10 calls about our appointment. Customer service for your company is apparently a joke at this point. This was, without a doubt, the worst service I have ever received by any company of any kind; and if I were the executive in charge of customer service, I would not admit to it."
"Jerry of Washougal, WA","April 19, 2012",1,"A year ago, I was advised by Comcast phone rep that bundled service (internet, phone and CATV) would not change from $119.99 for two years provided I agreed to have automatic payment from credit card for such term. I just received bill raising rate to $134.99. Phone contact today said contract was only for a year at which time it would increase and that there is a $90 charge to break such contract. I was not told any of this last year."
"Hussain of Willow Grove, PA","April 13, 2012",1,I pay for Comcast on-demand services. Why do I have to watch commercial ads on the part of the Comcast service that I pay for? This is annoying.
"Celia of Oregon city, OR","April 6, 2012",2,"After not having cable, phone or internet services for over a month, a Comcast representative came to my door with a check for $300 something. Two weeks later, I still don't have any services so I called Comcast and asked what the problem is. The billing department was so inflexible and said it wasn't their fault, the payment had not been received so I was told that I had to make another payment, that they will add a note stating that if the check was ever deposited, I will be refunded. This is where the lies all happened. After about 1 week, the check mysteriously appeared. This was 3 weeks later. Now, Comcast has taken over $750.00. After many calls with several different supervisors, I was told that nowhere in their system is such note about me getting my money back existed. Incredible. ""The calls are recorded for quality"", what ** quality? I was not able to pay all my rent. The representatives and supervisors were nothing but disrespectful, condescending and to this day, almost a month later, I still have not received my money. Bunch of thieves. It was all your company's fault. The only reason I still have your ** product is because there are no other options. I can for sure tell you that you are nothing but thieves and as soon as my ""credit"" that you say I have runs out, you will never ever be part of my family. You good for nothing liars.Upper management should have taken the time to read the supposed notes or at least listen to the multiple calls both my husband and I made as well as all the promises your reps made to us. Once more, thank you for nothing rats."
"Christine of Douglasville, GA","March 31, 2012",1,"We decided to try to save money by bundling our services, so right before Christmas of 2011, I made the grave mistake by ordering Comcast! First they accidentally changed my home phone number, so I spent hours on my cell phone with them being blown off by supervisors that were supposed to be calling me back to correct that and went almost a full week with four children with no phone service. Next, the cable boxes were incorrectly installed so the TVs upstairs would shut off and not stay on (wrong cable from technician) so My kids went their full Christmas vacation with no TV. So another technician came out to fix that. This was after more hours of being blown off and never taken care of. So I had to escalate my concerns to corporate level, who took care of things for me and credited me some charges for my aggravation. Okay. Great. But not without them telling me that my bill that was supposed to be $165 a month for being a new Comcast customer is really supposed to be $195 a month.logged in for my March bill to find out a $453 bill! So I opened up my PDF bill to find out over 25 porn movies that I never ordered being charged to my account! Over $370 worth over three months! So after calling Comcast again and being blown off again, I took the boxes to the Douglasville, GA location and signed for my boxes to be returned only to have the representative drill me about how old my kids were and how they could have ordered these movies! I was like ""Really? From school?"" So then she implied that I was ordering 8 movies in a row a day from multiple TVs in my home and watching them at the same time! Oh, it gets better! I got enraged at her accusations and started defending my family's honor only to have another customer behind me yell at me telling me I was out of line! We got into a yelling match and I just left with my receipt and have filed complaints with corporate, here and over the phone on the reg 800#. Not resolve yet! Do not go to Comcast! They only care about your money! That's It! You're only a # and a payday for them!"
"Urania of None, FL","March 26, 2012",1,"For being a loyal customer for over 3 years, Comcast treated me really bad. I tried to add more services through Comcast, and by doing that, I end up without services and a huge bill in less than 3 weeks. And I'm still waiting on them to correct my bill and cancel my services. When I called, they hung up on me. I don't want your services anymore ever!"
"Bonnie of Mount Joy, PA","March 19, 2012",1,"I recently tried to rent a 5 dollar movie for my niece, nephew, and daughter when they were having a sleep over. Well, I was 11 days late on my bill. Comcast, bills a month ahead of time so they added next month's bill on top of that, even though I haven't even entered the time frame for that billing service. So when I called I was told I am thirty days late on my bill and cannot order the movie. I hadn't even received my new bill in the mail yet, but because they charged my account, they said I am considered to be 30 days late on my payment. I was not even late enough for them to charge me a late fee but I am late enough for them to charge me for services I have yet to use and refuse to allow me to rent a 5 dollar movie. When I called they said there is nothing they could do that it is all automated. I have had service with Comcast for a number of years and never had an issue with them before. I wish I had another choice for service in my area but I do not. I think it is ** that they can charge me for something I haven't even used, but I can spend another 5 dollars for a movie. They should not be able to charge me for services I have not used and someone needs to do something about it."
"Mark  of Houston, TX","March 10, 2012",1,"In September, Comcast switched to digital ""upgrade"" and required everyone to get either boxes or adapter. The adapters are free. The boxes you get charged for even if your TV is cable ready – no box needed. At the end of January, Comcast started sending me a bill for their service. My service is paid thru my HOA dues. I did not upgrade to a box. I only use the adapters. After several phone calls, they said they would remove all charges and fees. They did not, but only removed half the bill. The next month I received another bill. Once again after several phone calls, they said it would be removed. They removed it and cut the cable, even though it’s paid thru the HOA. Here it is a month after and I have no cable and there’s another bill! I have spent the last hour and 40 minutes speaking with 6 different people to resolve this problem. I kept getting transferred and dropped or put on indefinite hold. This is harassment and bullying. I am fed up with Comcast. Everyone I speak to has the same problem. I want a class action lawsuit against Comcast for harassment, double billing, fraudulent advertising and over all scamming its customers. Prior to the switch, I had one remote for my TV and a couple of HD channels. After the switch I have no HD channels, a crappy picture and now I have to use 2 remotes to operate my TV."
"V of Newbury, MA","March 9, 2012",1,"I am 67. In all my years. I have never, ever dealt with a worse company in terms of product. Your support people are lovely and they trying to be helpful. But let me tell you what we have suffered with Comcast cable TV and Comcast Tivo: Awful, awful service. We have been able to use our TV about 2 months out of the last 12. We have had your service people here at least 15 times in the last year or so. We simply never can watch TV. Our service is always not working. I asked for a supervisor to call me back. None did. If I say that I will take your follow-up survey, the phone rings but there is no one there. I feel as if I am in the third world of a third world country. You truly can't represent yourselves as a service. You are a disgrace. We are switching service: Our computer, our TV, our phone and will never, ever use a Comcast service again. Further, I will be contacting our reps in congress to point out that you do not merit your licensing."
"Richard of Whately, MA","Feb. 24, 2012",2,"I reduced my Comcast cable service from Digital Starter to Digital Economy to save $40 per month as I was not using the extra services and channels.The channels clearly listed in the Price adjustment information sent out in December 2011 effective 1/22/2012. Problem is the second and third TV using the small converter box now only get half of the channels advertised in the listing. There is no mention of this in the footnotes of the terms of service. I think Comcast should have to live up to what is advertised and allow these channels to be viewed on the second and third TVs, not only one TV."
"Sara of Boca Raton, FL","Feb. 12, 2012",1,"I called Comcast to discuss a letter I received indicating that due to my move request, 'as discussed,' they would be charging me a deposit fee, either because of my credit check or because I refused a credit check.C. I've been a Comcast customer for 4.5 years.  My account is up to date.  Just because I am moving should not/does not justify a depositBut the bottom line is that I called to speak to them about it, and I have been on hold, so far, for 53 minutes, with no sign that anyone will ever pick up.  This is unacceptable.  I finally contacted someone via their Web site on chat and they did resolve my issue (removed the deposit, anyway).  However, I have an issue with being charged a deposit based on a conversation I supposedly had that never took place.  I also have an issue with being put on hold for an hour (I finally did hang up).  This is not an isolated incident as I have been on hold endlessly in the past as well.  At the very least, they should not be allowed to run commercials touting their customer service."
"Charlene of Burlingame, CA","Feb. 4, 2012",1,"The letter below was sent in May of 2011 to Corporate Escalations, Consumer Affairs and now to you. I have not heard anything so I wrongly assumed that everything was taken care of yet again. Yet here we are again. Yesterday, January 31, 2012 I received a call from an 800 number stating I owe $150.00 to Comcast for equipment I know nothing of. See the letter below which states all the facts and information concerning this issue. I am starting to feel harassed and extremely frustrated on how long and far this has gotten over something I have no control over and equipment I know nothing of. I will send this letter again to Comcast and Consumer Affairs.I have felt hesitant to write this letter and I have been dreading it. I'm afraid that even after this letter, nothing will get resolved because that has been the case since January of this year. I have had such a horrible experience with Comcast. I was with Comcast for years and it is only because there was no other service in Daly City. There have been price issues from the beginning of my contract with you, where we were quoted one price then given another. But that is not the reason why I am writing you today.This is the situation. I unfortunately have told this issue several times because for some reason I have had to repeat myself even though this should all be logged under my account. I lived in a house in Daly City with my brother and his wife. I moved out to Foster City with my boyfriend. I called Comcast customer service on December 23, 2010 to cancel my account because I was moving out. I asked if I was going to get any cancellation fee and if I need to know any other information before I cancel. They said that I will not have a cancellation fee but the final prorated fee would be $163.86. I asked what had to be done with the equipment and how long my brother and his family would have cable, internet, and phone accessibility for because they would still need to sign up for their own acct. I was told they would have 7 days and then it will all be cut off and I had seven days to return the equipment.My sister-in-law, Dhemy **, got in contact with Comcast herself and had issues as well. She was first told that she did not have to return any equipment because she was living in the same house and they should just keep the same equipment. But after the seventh day they still did not have cable or internet so she called Comcast. Then she was informed that she needed to go to the Pacifica office and change her account number and they informed her that she would have cable and internet working that same night. She did not have internet or cable working that night and so she called Comcast again and they said they would send a technician to the house the very next day between the early morning and early afternoon. My brother waited all day and no one came. My sister-in-law then called again and then Comcast said they would come the very next day. A technician did arrive around 7 am. This is the one and only time a technician came to the house, she informed me. He was there for about half an hour to an hour and asked where the modem, phone jack, and other items that she cannot remember for this was in December of last year. After he left, everything was working fine.Then everything went even more downhill from here. I started receiving calls from an unknown number **. I didn’t recognize it so I didn’t answer it and no messages were left so I assumed it was a prank call or wrong number. When I called it I didn’t recognize it either and it was an automated message. Finally I received my first notice in the mail from Credit Collection Services (CCS). It first stated that I owed $342.32 and that the creditor was Comcast. I was shocked and I called Comcast on February 4, 2011. I called 800-266-2278, which by the way takes forever just to speak with someone. When I finally spoke with someone they told me that I had a zero balance.So from that day I thought maybe it was just a mistake and maybe my account was just not updated. But I still received calls from Credit Collection Services. I talked to someone again from Comcast and it was said that I no longer have an existing account and I paid the balance of $162.32 already and that my account was clear. I received a new letter from CCS but for a different amount, $180.00. So I thought again that maybe my account is just not being updated. I think at this point we were not communicating clearly. I had to explain I am being charged $180.00 worth of equipment that I know nothing of. I was living in Daly City and my sister-in-law only saw one technician. She did not return any equipment or receive any new equipment. The account had been transferred already and I do not know anything else that went on in that house. It was getting really frustrating because I didn’t know what I had to do, especially if it has nothing to do with me and I no longer even had an existing account with Comcast. I still was receiving calls from Credit Collection Services and so I called Comcast again and explained what was going on. I spoke with Aretha on February 14, 2011. She made me aware that I just needed to make sure that everyone was aware that the account was transferred and she said she would put a note of that on my acct. So then I thought that was the last of it.But of course I still kept receiving calls from CCS. I called Comcast yet again and spoke with Yvonne on February 24, 2011. I expressed how frustrating this situation was and the fact that I had to keep explaining myself and nothing was being done about it. I even conferenced called my sister in law Dhemy with Comcast so we can both explain our story. We both know nothing of the ""equipment"" that is missing. Yvonne gave us the reference number of ** and said that this would all be inputted in both of our accounts. She told me that she would fax CCS as well with this information and let them know that the missing equipment has nothing to do with me. I do not know what exactly was done on Comcast’s end because nothing changed.I still received calls from CCS and I even explained to them what was going on and how frustrating this was for me. CCS told me they did not receive anything from Comcast concerning my due bill and would hold off on the calls until I can figure it out. By now you can only imagine how upset I was. Calling Comcast again, waiting on hold again, trying to get ahold of someone especially if I didn’t even have an account number to enter. I spoke to Monica on March 17, 2011. I then had to repeat my issue once again: ""I used to live with my brother and sister-in-law and then I moved out so I cancelled my account. I am now being tracked down by Credit Collection Services saying I owe $180 worth of equipment that I know nothing of. My family was told not to return any equipment because it was the same house. Only one technician was came to the house and Comcast doesn't even know his name. My credit is on the line now and I need this to be resolved."" I was extremely angry by then and it’s not even Monica's fault. She’s hearing this story for the first time. She puts me on hold. She comes back on the line and tells me that ""Comcast will take care of it.” I repeat, ""So Monica, you are telling me that Comcast will take care of this and I no longer have to worry about anything?"" She said yes. I repeat myself again at least 3 times because by now I have no trust or faith in Comcast. And she said ""yes.” ""So, Comcast will take care of this situation because of how frustrating, time consuming, and irritating this has been, and I do not have to worry about it and you will get ahold of CCS and let them know?” ""Yes. I contact CCS and let them know of all this information.”But of course, I start to receive calls again. By now I think I look like a joke to Comcast. I should have known that meant nothing. Your word meant nothing. I should not have believed that this would be taken care of. I called Comcast again with no patience. After waiting on hold again, I asked to automatically talk to a supervisor and I have to explain myself again over and over the same story. I tell Oscar the story and he then transfers me to Stacy the supervisor. I explain how very upset I am that you tell me that it is taken care of and this is what happens--the exact opposite? I am in customer service. I work at a hotel, front desk. I hear complaints. I get angry guests all the time. But if I say I will take care it, I do. Don’t you have the same policy? This was one of the most upsetting conversations. I couldn’t understand how it got this far. Why would customer service be like this? She then said that she would send a fax again and this time she was being honest. She wasn’t sure if it would get resolved. I appreciated that fact that she was at least being honest that she couldn’t just take care of it. But she would send a fax to CCS for me telling them everything. And we just had to wait and see if CCS would accept it.I waited to see if I still would get calls from CCS and low and behold, I still did. I guess it was not solved yet and the fax did not make a difference. Now I was at the end of my patience and sanity with this situation. I really feel like this issue was making me lose my mind. Something so small has gotten this big and it would not get resolved. This was the worst ongoing issue I have ever been thru with just a simple cable/internet situation. After receiving more calls and notices from CCS, I decided to conference call both Comcast and CCS so they can both talk and hear each other and my frustration. I talked first to Val from Comcast and asked to immediately to speak with a supervisor and yet again had to explain my story. I waited to get the supervisor on the phone, Larry, and then conference called Robert from CCS. I told them I needed immediate help. I needed to fix this problem and I do not know what to do anymore. I have been told this would be taken care of and it is still going on and now for 5 months. Larry continued to tell me that there was nothing he could do. And Robert told me he just needed a file/fax from Comcast stating that this case can be removed/has been solved. Larry told me the only temporary solution I had was to re-tell this story once again but to Corporate Comcast. That I needed to send a letter to corporate escalations and they would handle it from here on out. CCS said they would put this on hold for a little while. So I am sending this letter hoping something will be solved. I have no idea what equipment is missing. I moved out of the house in Daly city and my brother and sister-in-law know nothing of this either because they were specifically told not to return anything because they lived in the same house, that they only needed to change their account number. The only person that has been to the house after me was the one technician. I do not know what changes he made. And surprisingly, Comcast has no information on the one technician that was here. Comcast does not know who, his name or anything about it, which is horrible. Isn't there a way to keep track of those things? My sister-in-law doesn't know his name and did not watch every single move he made. She trusted that he would get the job done, which happened. They have cable and internet. I'm not saying he stole equipment, but maybe he was told to retrieve equipment or replace older equipment. I have no idea what happened here, but I am being blamed for it and frankly I am tired of this. We were told several times that they would look into the case where the one technician came to the house but I haven’t heard anything about that. For some odd reason there is no record of who went to the house or how we can talk to him and see if he saw anything or replaced anything. I do not want to repeat this story again. I cannot call Comcast, stay on hold, try to talk to someone, tell my story again, and nothing be resolved. My credit is on the line right now. I do not even own a home and I'm in the middle of paying my car off. I really do not need bad credit all because of this. I am now doing what I am told: to write corporate escalations. Please tell me, what will this result in? Will anything change or will I just forever have to keep calling Comcast and Credit Collection Services back and forth. I will not pay $180 for equipment that I know nothing of. I am not made of money just like everybody else in this world. I'm not just going to throw money away. I really truly hope there is a solution in the end. I hope you can put yourself in my shoes and understand just where I am coming from. I will also send this letter to Consumer Affairs so that way if/when this is not solved thru corporate escalations, then maybe Consumer Affairs can help."
"Firs of San Diego, CA","Jan. 31, 2012",1,"Issue 1) Rather minor, but here for completeness. After cancelling my Comcast service, I was told that they owned my cable modem, and they attempted to charge me for my own property. That disagreement only took 5 or 6 weeks and multiple phone calls to resolve, so I guess we're making progress.Issue 2) I cancelled service and returned my equipment on the 13th of December, but on the 15th of December I was incorrectly billed for the month of January.After numerous calls, we've been repeatedly told that Comcast does not bill in advance, so they don't owe us the money from their erroneous January billing. Unfortunately no documentation is offered to support this position. In direct contradiction to these verbal assurances that they have a right to steal our money, it's clear from all of Comcast's *written* documentation that Comcast does indeed bill a month in advance, not in mid-cycle as their staff has insisted. All of our billing statements, the installation invoice we retained from 2003 (when we initiated service), and their corporate website state quite clearly that Comcast does indeed bill a month in advance.That is, until it's time to cancel.I can find no reference to mid-cycle billing on their site and in fact the only time it's been referenced has been during verbal communications with their staff. In a curious twist, we went to their service center and before we told the associate what we had come to discuss, we asked them if their policy was to require advance payment for the following month.They then, without hesitation, acknowledged that to be the case. That is, until I told them I wanted to be reimbursed for the final month, at which point the story miraculously changed. Then our advanced payment for the month of January was characterized as a mid-cycle payment for the month of December.Comcast staff is quite clearly confused on the difference between billing cycles and service periods; it's unclear if this is by intent, or just the result of regrettably substandard corporate training. Of course this confusion is only tolerated because it results in more money flowing to corporate coffers; as a software developer who has worked on billing systems, I can assure you that had the confusion resulted in a loss for Comcast, it would be corrected quite quickly, likely resulting in the termination of those involved. But 'happy accidents' redounding to the benefit of Comcast seem to be tolerated with remarkable equanimity.Here is a link to Comcast's corporate policy, straight from the website. I can also provide any interested parties with scans of the installer's invoice from 2003 as well as every bill we've received over the course of 8 years, all of which clearly state this policy, as well as the fact that the mid-month billings apply to cable service for the following month.http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/HelpNFC.aspx?id=Article-understanding-your-bill-----------------------------------So in my mind, one of these things should happen:3) They should reimburse me for the improper billing for the month of January."
"Anant of Columbia, MD","Jan. 13, 2012",1,I have been paying Comcast for Digital Preferred channels since September 2011 and I realized after 6 months (after chatting with the rep.) that I am still on digital starter. It is a complete rip-off.
"Manny of Pembroke Pines, FL","Jan. 4, 2012",1,"I have been a Comcast customer for over 10 years! About 6 or 7years ago, I tried to connect Vonage phone service to my Comcast Internet. The service would not work right. Long story short, Comcast Internet could not handle the load. I disconnected Vonage. Comcast since has upgraded their Internet speeds, but I continue to have Internet intermittent drops and speed issues. Comcast has sent supervisors, level 2 technicians and the problem continues. I am currently experiencing problems and I have to reset my modem every morning because the signal drops every evening. Comcast has twice, tried to charge me to send technicians out. We have spent hours upon hours on the phone with them and the issues do not get resolved. I keep getting the run around by technicians who don't know what to do as they keep telling me their supervisors are working on the problem. Comcast supervisors do not return calls. After a while of contacting technicians, they blow me off. Just yesterday, I called the last technician who is currently working on my trouble ticket and he asked if he can call me back in ten minutes. Twenty-four hours later, I'm still waiting. Comcast has sent dozens of technicians out here and they all do the same thing. They check the jacks, they check the signal strength (always finding noise), they check the drop and the cable box outside of my house. They go into the attic and check the splitter, tighten the lines and leave. I know their routine so well that when they arrive I tell them exactly what they are going to do and that it doesn't help. Then they do it anyway. They have told me a dozen times, they need to ""escalate"" the problem so mechanical and maintenance can check the lines and poles in my community. Never happens! I have a home business and I need the high speed Internet. I have built my business around it so Comcast takes advantage of the fact that I cannot cancel the service. DSL is more expensive and slower. Dish is horrible and a T1 line is way above my budget."
"Dawn of West Creek, NJ","Dec. 24, 2011",1,"First I was told I wouldn't be charged for getting my service on initially. Then they charged me anyway. Then they said that was my one free home service and next time I would be charged. The prices are out of control! I feel like they are price gougers and should be stopped. I pay more for to this lousy company than I have to for my gas and electric combined. If my child wasn't disabled, I would cancel this minute! Autism is the only reason I can't! Awful that the state allows this to happen! I have a neighbor with a Comcast sucks sign in front of their home! And I agree! Totally!"
"Pablo of Fort lauderdale, fl","Dec. 9, 2011",1,"This is a complaint against Comcast. I have with the business class internet service under account **. For the past week, I spent an average of one hour on the phone at their published number 800 391 3000 trying to get them to cancel my service and to no avail. Comcast consistently refuses to cancel, telling me instead that they need to send me a ‘form’ for me to sign, but they never do.Most of the calls get dropped between a labyrinth of ‘transfers’ from one agent to the other, but never get to the point where I can actually cancel my service. I went in person to their location at 1139 N Federal Hwy, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304 and David at the counter told me that they ‘can’t handle business accounts’ and referred me back to calling them on the phone.I disconnected the modem, I am not using the service and I do not want to pay for it anymore. I find it unacceptable if not outright deceptive to keep customers ‘hooked’ by refusing to cancel service."
"Theodore of College Park, MD","Nov. 17, 2011",1,"They sold to an 85 year old woman a digital TV box for about $300 for a digital TV she did not have at the time. One year later, son (me) buys a digital TV. First digital box picked up at office has wrong power supply and the second digital box is defective. We were without cable for 5 days. This is senior citizen abuse plus terrible customer service. Son is owner of account and is dumping the company."
"Darla of Wyndmoor, PA","Nov. 4, 2011",1,"I returned my cable boxes at 1 Apollo Road in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The woman working at the counter to process my return on Friday 11/4 at 4:50 PM was extremely rude. She yelled at me during the entire process. You have to push the boxes through a clear plastic doors and she rudely informed me of the very consumer unfriendly process. Comcast should be ashamed of themselves to allow someone with her bad attitude to service customers. This will further, my promise to never deal with Comcast again."
"Jarron of Ocala, FL","Nov. 1, 2011",1,"My latest experience with Comcast was when the last of my channels was lost due to XFinity coming to my area. Fine. I lived without it, until we decided on a course of action. I called and ordered a DVR (One of the worst pieces of ** I've ever used btw) and two regular set-top boxes. The lady was very helpful, kind, courteous. I waited almost a week past delivery due date, and called.  The lady I spoke to this time was very helpful, kind, courteous- my order had shipped, and was in route. I waited almost another two weeks. I called again after being hung up on four times by some very rude individuals, and calling back, the lady I spoke to was very helpful, kind, courteous- but could find no record of my order, despite my having the #. She placed the order again, and we parted ways very nicely. I waited a little over two weeks and called, this time, after being hung up on twice and calling back, gentleman I spoke with was not helpful, kind, or courteous -despite my starting out pleasantly and he could find no record of my order. The warehouse knew nothing about it and there was no record of my having called, despite my having both the old and new order #s. I asked him to make note of it and the fact I was very unhappy. He was rude to the point I hung up and emailed Comcast cares with transcripts of all my calls. A Mr. Carlos ** contacted me, and was dumbfounded at the trouble I had gone through and the uncaring attitudes of their employees. He wiped the slate cleaned, set up an appointment for a tech to bring me the items I had ordered, and install them, all free of charge! Great! Thank you!The day before the tech was to arrive I received three very large boxes by UPS, and yes, inside of them were all the orders that no one knew anything about, that had been canceled, etc. I immediately contacted Mr. **, and he promised we would not be charged for the items, and would receive a credit for all the past inconveniences (Have not seen that yet). Tech came out to install the DVR (Had to replace it once already and the ""new"" one doesn't want to record) and the set-top boxes (Had to have the one replaced twice already and the other just shows to be announced despite a tech walking me through the rebooting steps). We were charged for two new outlets (Total of three) though we have always had three and the new ones were not new, but had been here 14 years. The tech even told me as he was leaving, Comcast really needed to get their act together. So, my overall experience with Comcast, over the last 14 years? I find -despite the employees comments I have read- that Comcast has some of the rudest customer care staff I've ever dealt with. Rude, nasty, sarcastic, and mean. The phrase we are people too means little to me, because when you are behind that phone, speaking on behalf of Comcast, you are no longer an individual with baby-feelings that you allow to get hurt when someone frustrated with the service you provide, takes it out on you. You are Comcast. They don't know you as an individual, and don't care to. They want what they paid for to work, and work well- they want the service to justify the expense of the cost (I am now paying 119 a month, for really nothing other than being allowed to view the channels I should be allowed to view any way), which can, at times be a lot more than what we get back. By the time they get to you, they may have been hung up on numerous times, pawned off on others that had no idea what they were doing, or simply lied to. Your feelings get hurt by abusive customers? Too bad. That's what you are there for. To settle their problems. Suck it up or quit. We don't need people that ""just don't care about your services problems"". We need people that realize their company is not always honest, reliable, or even kind."
"Chris of Avon Park, FL","Oct. 17, 2011",1,"I paid my bill online. 8 hours later, they charged the same amount causing my account to be overdrawn which caused other checks to bounce. I contacted on phone and they disputed the second charge. I went to my bank and got a statement showing they charged me twice. I went to the office and showed them documentation, they still disputed the second charge because it was pending. It was pending because my bank did not pay, because it caused my account to be overdrawn. It only paid what my available balance was."
"Matt of Weston, FL","Sept. 24, 2011",1,"I give my experience a big fat zero star but I had to pick one. Not one but two Comcast technicians came into my house and dismantled my existing TV antenna system, Satellite system, and part of my Ethernet network! After two separate installation attempts, two technicians, two lost days of work, and still no service. I asked them to remove all of their equipment and return the house wiring to its original condition. What I got were two technicians that got into their trucks and left! They just left! I had to disconnect their equipment and attempt to reinstall some semblance of a working system until I could call out an expert to do the repairs.Calling an expert cost me $138.0 just to get part of the system(s) in working order and the rest of the recabling will take several hundred dollars more to trace each wire or cable that these clowns removed for no reason!One last note, the so-called technicians come in rundown trucks, no Comcast markings and it seems to me that they are hired outside contractors. I don't think these ""gentlemen"" were Comcast employees. At least the AT&T guy that came to repair some of the damage, which these guys created, was neat, had and ID, and had a marked truck.I wanted to switch to Comcast because of a lower price. I guess, you get what you pay for!"
"Arin of Berwick, ME","Sept. 21, 2011",1,"I filed a complaint with the Attorney General. Unethical selling practices, prices way too high. They will try to get you to get a package deal. Lying. Excessive lying. I got different prices from different customer representatives, not mentioning the installation fee. They lied about Fairpoint charging a rent for their modem and trying to get me to get a local phone that is supposedly ""free"", but it's not. The worst offense to me is the lying."
"Valarie of Fort Wayne, IN","Sept. 21, 2011",1,"On or around August 19th, 2011, I requested service with Comcast. On August 20th, my service was connected in my home. On or around August 24, 2011, I received my first bill with a bill date of August 21, 2011 with the bill being due on the 10th of September. Two weeks later, I received another bill from Comcast with a due date of September 24th.On September 21, I contacted Comcast via live chat to inquire about the change in my bill date. I was informed by Josie ** that the first bill from Comcast is prorated depending on when you requested service. My first bill was not, I paid for a full month's worth of service. Josie informed me that my service billing cycle is from August 21-September 19 and September 20-October 10. I again asked about the change in my bill date from the 21st to the 7th. I then stated that my being billed on the 7th of the month is not one full month's worth of billing and that it is actually 17 days that I am being billed for since my bill is due on the 24th. I then asked how can Comcast bill me on the 7th when I did not request my initial service until the 20th of the month? After reading all of the complaints against Comcast, I am astonished that they are able to get away with all they have been doing. One customer through out the possibility of a class action lawsuit against Comcast, and I believe that customer has the right idea."

"Jessica of Fitchburg, MA","Sept. 13, 2011",1,"Plain and simple--Comcast is awful.  Upon moving to a new apartment, we contacted our cable and Internet provider at the time (Verizon) to have our service hooked up at the new address.  Unfortunately, the move took place during the strike and we were told that they would not be able to hook up our service until the strike was over.  We went without cable and Internet for three weeks and finally decided to go with the only other option we had left (besides satellite TV), Comcast.  We reluctantly went forward with the decision since Verizon has Comcast beat by a mile from prices, packages, and quality.Comcast has an angle for everything and charges tons of extra money for things that Verizon automatically includes in their service.  We have had Comcast for less than a month.  While the Internet connection is fair, the cable quality is downright awful.  The channels continuously go blank or ""scrambled"" for several minutes at a time and the Channel Guide seems to reset and has ""To Be Announced"" in place of program titles.  Needless to say, after less than a month of service with Comcast, we are switching back to Verizon now that the strike is over."
"Mrs. of Long Branch, NJ","Sept. 12, 2011",1,"I have the Comcast Triple Play and have been disconnected hundreds of times from internet but numerous times from all 3 of my services. I was told repeatedly whenever they come here that everything is fine inside and the problem is at the pole. The problem has been diagnosed by them as: that the 8 connections at the pole were not labeled and then that: there was a 4-connection power strip with two double connectors beneath and the problem is most likely the 2 splitters at the pole result in loss of connectivity.Meanwhile, we play musical wires at the pole and I keep getting disconnected and was told everything was fine. And behold, I busted a technician at the pole on 07 Sept 2011 and asked him if he was not there to fix my issues, why was he touching my wires and that he disconnected me three times. I asked his name, and left a live voicemail as the situation was going down for the president's representative, Jennifer. It was a great, vindicating feeling to bust someone because they keep telling me everything's fine, like I have nothing better to do than call about getting disconnected!I had filed a complaint to the FCC last week. Attorneys filing class action lawsuits may feel free to contact me. There are numerous trouble tickets Comcast should be able to be forced to supply via subpoena if necessary, not to mention my cellphone records and landline records as proof. I have mainly called from my cellphone since my modem and phone service go through the one box."

"Cherie of Fresno, CA","Aug. 9, 2011",1,"I had been a Comcast customer for over 16 years and had on and off been behind in my bill.  I would get caught up always pay current amount due.  Recently due to health issues I had become behind but was paying upwards of 450.00 every month.  I had recently moved and after the move I had found out that Comcast has illegally released not only my new phone number, but my new address to 411.  One of the reasons I had moved was that I had a stalker (police say nothng they can do unless he does something) and I wanted to get away from him.  I think this guy got my name from my name badge when I worked for Kaiser and it was not long after I moved and found out that my information had been released that this guy started to come around my new home.  When I contacted Comcast I spoke to a Wendy and a Larry and all information should be in my comcast file. Anyway they had stated that what had happened was wrong and that they should not have released my information, not only without my permission, but I was paying extra on my bill to keep this information non published.  Larry went to his supervisor becasuse I had said I felt they needed to pay to move me again and after talking with his supervisor he said there is nothing that they can do or be responsible for.  I mean does something bad have to happen to me, my property or dogs for them to be responsible? Larry just kept saying we are not going to be responsbile, but they thing is they are the ones responsible for this mess.  I even asked if they would zero out my comcast bill about (900.00) and give me free service (which had included phone for emergency and general use) for a while until I could save the money to move myself.  I was also denied this.  So not only have they denied any of my requests, they continued to bill me for two months I did not even have service and when the field represenitive came out to contact me to get thier equipment I was out of town, but my son was home and they jumped my fence with a no tresspassing sign on it and after doing that and making contact with my son they discuss my account with him.

"Lynda of Kittery, ME","July 28, 2011",1,"A year or two ago, when the government made their changes to the TV airwaves to the whole country, we were assured that as long as you have cable TV, you would  be okay, and would not be affected. Comcast told its customers the same, ""you'll be okay"", and “wouldn't need to do anything.” About one year later, ooops, Comcast tells us they are changing, and you'll have to get the new type of service and boxes (for each TV). If you don't, you go down to the lowest level, and will barely get any channels at all. Of course the new service was much higher, but we went with it. NOW, almost a year later to the day, got another notice, saying THAT service will no longer be available, and we will have to get the NEW service and MORE NEW boxes (at a cost), or basically we will have nothing, and they gave me about two weeks to decide. First thought to come to my mind? ""You people S**K, and should be ashamed! Comcast is the only reason I complain at only being given two weeks to decide. I'm trying to decide whether to switch to Dish Network or DirecTV, and there's a lot of research I need to do to decide.This is what happens when one company is allowed to have a monopoly. In this day and age, why is this still allowed?"

"John of Bonita Springs, FL","June 29, 2011",0,"Our Home Owners Association was informed by Comcast that we must convert all of our TVs with ""digital adapters"" effective late June. Comcast provided ""conversion kits"" with ""DTA boxes"" and channel changers for each of three TVs. As an engineer and past owner/manager of a handyman business, I am reasonably technical but the Comcast TV Conversion Kits are nothing more than Comcast's best attempt to control, convert and force customers to upgrade their systems/services so that Comcast can make more money. The installation process is anything but simple and requires numerous ""program codes"" for each TV and TV channel changer. The old analog system was much simpler and more reliable. I guess we didn't learn our lesson from the auto industry, keep it simple, reliable and cost effective or customers will go elsewhere!"

When I called to complain they just said they took away those channels with no real explanation given. I accepted this answer, as it wasn't too big of a deal since we still had On Demand service and my son could watch his Nick shows, etc. Well, just a few weeks ago I realized they have now taken away our On Demand service for these channels since we ""are not subscribers"".

"Maria of Port Saint Lucie, FL","Feb. 5, 2011",0,"I have a two-year agreement for a triple bundle, which total price is $114.09 for the first year, and $10.00 more for the second year. I asked over and over before I took this agreement, if I would still get all my TV channels on all my other TVs without any additional cost. They said I would still get everything I had, and I would not have to get a box for each. Now they want $1.99 plus tax and fees for each additional TV over the first two. I have five.What's worse is they raised the price of my modem to $2.27 per month and said that's not part of my agreement. My bundle is for phone, TV, and internet. Without the modem, I can't get phone or internet, so how can that not be part of the agreement?!

"Alix of Brookline, MA","Oct. 31, 2010",0,"I should have sensed trouble in the fact that the installing technician was in such a hurry to get the job done that he could hardly give me the time to explain what he had done. Since that day, I have had trouble with my internet. Access has been barred to many sites and a Comcast message comes up ""Oops! Activation incomplete.""I have called three times. Nothing compared to some of your contributors and the last call to a ""supervisor"" (I wonder) I was assured that the problem would be fixed within 48 hours at the most and probably less. Well, no surprise, four days later nothing has been ""fixed."" My frustration is only beginning, I guess, but one does wonder about the financial impact on the company to have to keep coming back for ""fixes"" instead of getting the job done right to begin with. I would think it would be more cost efficient to do quality work in the first place, even if it cost a bit more to hire better qualified technicians than to string the work out over several weeks, months, years? I'm sure the costs incurred is being passed on to the customer(s) so maybe they do it on purpose. Is this fraudulent?"
"Brent of Byron Center, MI","Oct. 28, 2010",0,"It looks like Comcast has decided to use the switch to digital to its advantage. This wasn't evident to me at first but on October 26, 2010, I discovered that my current level of service was no longer being offered. I had to either accept fewer channels or increase my bill by $40 per month and gain quite a few channels. Our household has had limited basic cable for 15 years. The price has increased from around $12 per month to $19.95 in that time period. We even moved once with no noticeable change to our plan. Now Comcast is telling me that I'm getting channels I shouldn't, and that I must accept fewer channels for the same amount or pay $60 per month (but they do have a 6-month special). This is because with the switch to digital, the limited basic package was reduced and for the last year or so I've been getting channels I shouldn't.From what I can gather, Comcast does not want limited basic cable customers. This reduction in service is an attempt to purge this level of service. I've been told that you can't call up and receive limited basic cable - only those who've had it are allowed to keep it. Once you're out you can't get it any more. It seems convenient for Comcast to blame this on the switch to digital.By the way, I'm not even sure Comcast has their story straight. The first rep I talked with said I could go pick up the technology I need from a Customer Service center (no mention of fees or charges). The second one I spoke with said that I must choose a $60 plan if I wanted more than channels 2-28 with my cable. "
"Casy of Sebring, FL","Oct. 27, 2010",0,"The reason that I’m filing this complaint is that I had cable for 4 months through Comcast. When they cut the cable due to nonpayment, they tried to charge me for an additional two months. So I called them and they took the charge off, but they informed me that I would have to pay a month in advance to have my cable turned back on along with the outstanding bill."
"Shakieta of Lawrenceville, GA","Oct. 18, 2010",0,"My service was interrupted for past due payment of August 2010 (13 days). Someone outside the finance department contacted me Saturday, September 4th, 2010, stating if I pay half the amount my services, which include phone, DSL, and cable, I will be back up if I make this $95.00 payment and the remaining balance on the 21st of September. Once I paid her on the phone, she stated that my service will be back up. I asked her if they were going to reimburse me for the almost two weeks of not having either service and she said yes and it will take at least 2 billing cycles to show on account.I contacted Comcast today (October 18th 2010) and stated that my service was interrupted and I will not get my bill prorated. I don't understand. If I wasn't able to use any service, not even phone and watch television, why was I still getting bill and didn't get to watch? I think this is thief for a company to charge me for almost two weeks with not one service available and tell me that they will prorate the bill just to get a payment."
"Richard of Vero Beach, FL","Oct. 14, 2010",0,"I was a Comcast's customer for years, after it took over Florida Cablevision. What first got my attention was how programs were shifted around to different 'tiers', meaning I'd have to pay more to watch programs I had previously gotten with my account. I also had to take a ton of sports and Hispanic channels, which I had no use for. Then came the frequent increases in service costs, driving my bill up from around $60 a month to over $100.One service change came in the form of a letter, telling subscribers to pick 1 of a few bundles listed, as the company was making channel changes. No information on the bundles, including no listed costs. I had to call customer service to figure it out and basically was told I'd be paying more for the same service no matter what I did. Then, since I'm a night person, I discovered over 60% of my night time viewing channels, that used to replay the days shows, now were packed with paid programming and infomercials. So, I was paying for service that now had been reduced in quality.I did note, years ago, how easily Comcast managed to get the act of 'stealing cable' or making an illegal hookup raised from a misdemeanor to a felony. With more serious crimes about being classified as misdemeanors, I wondered how much Comcast had paid congressmen to push that law through. I liked the pay-per-view, until I discovered that I'd pay about $5.99 for a movie, only to find it being played for free on one of the prime stations 6 months later.Then the infomercials started expanding from between midnight and 6 AM to mornings until around 9 AM. I assumed Comcast made more money from them, so was going to throw them in everywhere, since, after all, they are technically a monopoly in most areas. I dumped Comcast and got AT&T. Including DSL Internet. I didn't discover until later that Comcast bought AT&T high speed Internet which was never mentioned in any of the information I read before signing up for it. Like a cancer, they seem to be spreading. Monopolies are illegal in the US, but apparently, Comcast is above the law."
"Michael of Flemington, NJ","Sept. 23, 2010",0,"My issue was originally diagnosed on August 27th as a weak signal in the underground cable line coming into my house. The technician ordered a new line to be installed on Sept 2nd. It is now Sept 23rd, and the line has still not been installed. For the past month, I have made over 10 calls to Comcast, and have been promised that the crew will be at my house to install the line ""the next day"". I have intermittent TV and internet connections that go in and out randomly, and I am at my wit's end. None of the customer service reps or supervisors I have spoken to have been helpful at all."
"Mary of San jose, ca","Sept. 21, 2010",0,"We cancelled Comcast because of constant picture problems with a paper trail probably going back ten years. We always got a different answer everytime they came out. One serviceman told use there was a cable problem outside with a cost of over $20,000 that Comcast wasn't willing to spend the money to repair. We were also told it was our problem and they would have to charge us to replace the lines under the house. After numerous servicemen and several different answers, we switched to direcTV and have a perfect picture. The serviceman also stated that the neighbors were also having problems and it just wasn't us. We refused to pay the bill after they couldn't fix the problem and they sent it in to a collection agency. When you spend over a $100.00 a month, you expect quality, which we never had. Their customer service is horrific."
"Adrian of Houston, TX","Sept. 13, 2010",0,"First of all, this happened back in the beginning of August the 1st, which I had 30 days to decide what I wanted to do. When I first spoke to the lady, who signed me up with the contract, I specifically told her I work for LabCorp and I asked her about the corporate discount. She said, we can give you a discount but with the package you have, it would be cheaper. So I decided to stay with the package. Then she told me, what I can do for you to substitute the discount is not to charge you for the installation and box fee. I told her, are you sure? She said, ""Yes and it would be only $29.99 plus tax. All I have to do is put a note and notify my supervisor. They'll call you back in 24 to 48 hours"". Since then, it has been the worst 3 weeks of my life. They never called me back and Paula, the supervisor, was really unprofessional."
"Dan of Kensington, MD","Sept. 3, 2010",0,I just want to tell anybody who can read this: Do not use Comcast cable TV service. I cannot get a human to report the signal lost after several tries. I do not have signal for 2 weeks. Every time I was told they are busy and to call later. They even did not offer me a chance to wait.
"Kathy of Novato, CA","Aug. 18, 2010",0,"I received a call several weeks ago from a Comcast telemarketer who offered me a ""deal"" for services I was not receiving.  He said that I would also get faster Internet service if I were to accept the deal.  Internet service is internet service--I can't understand why they were claiming that they can increase the speed.  That's ridiculous.  It makes me feel that they are holding out on me.I received a new Comcast bill and did not understand why I needed to pay more and exactly what I was paying for.  The young woman I spoke with was hard to understand--because the English was not that good and because she did not seem to understand the price structure.  She sent me to the Web site.  I navigated to that and had to put in my address and zip code to see prices, which makes me think that people are offered different prices depending on I really don't know what.So I saw that they are offering an incredible deal to new customers.  The cost of which (for the same services I get now) is half of what I pay.  There is a contract involved but the great pricing can last up to two years.  This is blatantly not fair.  That is like me going into a grocery store and paying a different price based on something like my hair color.  Service costs should be the same across the board."
"Lola of Cordova, TN","Aug. 8, 2010",0,"June 1, 2010, Comcast cable offered a special for a starter pack that included channels (86 and 235) that are no longer available, due to the changes of channels in the package. I have, from the time, been viewing channels especially, 86 and 235.  I was told that the network changed, and that they are no longer available in my package.  My complaint is that I paid for these channels in the beginning, and should continue receiving them until the 12 months have expired, or the price should be decreased, since it is no longer available for package.  Spoke with Mr. **, and he explained that it was available for my package at the time, and that the network had upgraded it to another package, and that I can get it for an additional $10.  This is unfair business as if it was set-up for me to enjoy such channels, and then take it away, for me to pay more for what I already had. The gentleman refused to give me back the channels I originally had. This is preposterous. Please help resolve this scheme of Comcast cable. Comcast is asking for more money for services, that was already a part of a package deal, and suddenly they take several channels away, from the original offer, to get more for what it was originally offered for."
"Yevette of Muskegon, MI","Aug. 5, 2010",0,"I have been a customer with Comcast for over 10 years. I pay for high speed internet which is a joke. They charge top prices and have a junk product. I have to call them every other day because my internet never works. How can nothing be done about this? Wait time to talk to someone who can never help is 10 + minutes. So with that being said, I know I am not the only one. We have service tech's from Comcast out to our house at least once a week. When they come out service will work for a few hours then it's back down again! I am a real estate agent with a home office and can never use my internet. This cost me deals and is very upsetting."

After several weeks it never came, I called customer service and got someone I could barely understand who put me on hold for 15 minutes before I was cut off. I just got a bill for almost $200 for a service I have not only ever used; I never even got the start up kit to install in the first place! I called customer service today and was on hold between 2 different operators for no less than 33 minutes according to my call timers before I spoke to a supervisor. As with the reps the supervisor had limited ability to understand English! This is the worst customer service department I have ever dealt with even the IRS! I canceled my service and went to direct TV which appears to have English speaking reps. My bill was adjusted after almost an hour with these people telling me I have a service I don't Have completely unreal! Very upset with all this out sourcing. Bring our companies back home!"
"Michelle of East Haven, CT","July 14, 2010",0,"I am moving out of my current residence in about two weeks. Cable service was set up about a month ago for my new residence. I had ordered the service in my name with no one else on the account. My roommate had to call Comcast last night about his wife's account with who he is separated from. Comcast ask him which account ""You have three."" One of the three accounts was my new address. They verfied that his name and social security number was on the account. He freaked out and had them cancel the install. Now I never gave them permission to put him on the account nor did he give them permission to put his name on the account. I was at work when he found this out. He called me up and left three nasty voice mails accusing me of identity theft and fraud and was going to have me prosecuted. I had called Comcast.

"Melanie of Baytown, TX","July 5, 2010",0,"Let me first start by stating that I live in an area where the only high-speed cable access is provided by Comcast. I have continually had a problem with slow speed with Comcast's premium connection. I've called in the past, and every time I am directed through troubleshooting procedure which includes checking cables, unplugging modem, etc. This process works, but lately my speed diminishes on a daily basis. The way I approach the problem these days is to call the automated line and get a signal refresh. Like magic this method works every time.Given the current negotiations between the FCC and ISP providers and the latest attempt to charge according to data use, I believe Comcast limits my connection speed until I call them. There is no doubt in my mind that I am paying a premium price for a sub-par service. Anybody that tells you that you get what you pay for in this Country is full of it. It simply is not true. Until we get real consumer protections again, moreover regulatory laws with regard to ISP services, save yourself the hassle and call for a refresh signal."
"Jytte of Miramar, FL","June 29, 2010",0,"We have been loyal Comcast customers for 10 years. We moved county and had to change account. This is when trouble started. We bought a new HD and 3D TV and consulted with Comcast to ensure we would get the services from them. Yes, 3D is available, I was told. 4 DVR/digital boxes and five technicians later and approximately 20 hours total phone calls during the 4 weeks, we still don't have 3D. Comcast agents have no clue when it is available here in Florida. Two weeks ago I was told June 29 and I received the right box to be able to receive it. Today is June 29 and after 3 hours (no kidding) on the phone since 7 am with Comcast, I was told by different agents: 1. you do no have the right box (incorrect); 2. you have the wrong TV (incorrect); 3. we need to send a technician to fix the problem (will be available in 3 days); 4. 3D is not available in your area yet; 5. and it's not a problem specific to you but several customers.All within 3 hours different agents made these statements and decided that there was nothing else they could do. I was trying to speak with a supervisor who could shed some light on the situation, but agents hung up on me instead. This is a typical example of my day on the phone with Comcast. I'm ready to switch to satellite. Unfortunately our home owner association has a contract with Comcast, which we opted in on when we moved here, anticipating they would be able to live up to their commitment. This has resulted to 20 hours of phone calls resulting in lost work/revenue on my side. Trying to get out of the home owners association's basic cable agreement with Comcast. We do not want to pay for services we no longer get after we switch to satellite."

"Gary of San jose, ca","June 5, 2010",0,"For the year, I had them, they gave me the run around about $99/month billing. My contract shows $90/month in two different places. Now that I am cancelled (can one ever get away from those people? ), as of Sept. 2009 (I went to Taiwan), they continue to bill me! (While in the lobby, I observed three different people there for no other business than to ask, ""Why, when I cancelled service, are you still charging me?"") I return in March 2010 and called to ask the same thing to which I was assured things would be taken care of. I came back June of this year to find my bill has gone to collections and they are threatening to go to the three credit reporting agencies! Did I mention, while I was gone I had some people from South Korea staying at my house and Comcast came by and managed to get $124 out of them? So, now I am back and I wish I could charge them for all the time I am spending on this most not American of dealings! I am given a confirmation number for a time that they will call (it has been ""escalated""), and I need to be by the phone from Wed. to Fri. in the morning hours. The time came and went to no avail!When I called back, they were all apologetic, but happy to set me up with another conformation number for a call back. No thank you! Oh, by the way, and this is a dozy, honest! My neighbor across the street, they had them for 1 and 1/2 months, deciding to cancel. It was easier pulling out your wisdom teeth with a pair of pliers without Novocaine! The bill reached above $700, so my neighbor made a deal. They said, ""split the cost, you walk away, and never bother us again!"" Comcast accepted this! And now my neighbors do not even want to enter into a class action law suit, should I be able to wrangle one! But, my neighbors stated, if Comcast comes around offering their services for 10 years, and for free, they still would not accept!They are, by far, the most maddening, irresponsible, inept, clingy, blind, deaf and dumb, ungracious, do nothing, clumsy, muddle headed, two faced, idiotic, right hand not knowing what its left hand is doing company, that has ever spawned a desire to succeed, on the face of the planet, that I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with! What makes them think that, once you enter into a contract with them, that they own you for life? I will report them and I will sue them for all of my time! I will do my best effort to make them blink! How dare they! They are without shame! PS. I do not think they have anybody in this area code any more. That is, now that I have quit them! $124.00 and the threats of it being reported to the credit card reporting agencies! Time and distraction."
"Tammy of Spring , TX","May 26, 2010",0,"I've been with Comcast since the switch a few years ago. I thought Time Warner was bad about things like accounting methods, repair services and CSRs who clearly have no idea what they are doing - whether you get them on the phone or have the misfortune to have them come to your home. A few weeks ago, contractors fixing my neighbor's fence sliced through the cable line, disconnecting all my services. I called the customer service line, told them the problem and the guy told me he was going to ""expedite"" the order because I had no services whatsoever at that time. Three days went by and no Comcast, so I called back and they told me they have no record of me calling at all. As to the reference number I was given, the operator told me there is always a six digit number and I only had four. The real kicker, when I asked for another reference number in case the same thing happens again, she gave me a five digit number!When I called her on it, she said that was the number coming up on her screen, so that was the one I should use if I had to call back. The next day, they finally made it to my house to fix the problem, which they did, only the tech didn't rebury the lines and told me I would have to call Comcast and have them send another tech guy to do this, that he wasn't responsible for doing this. I just don't understand how these people get away with running a company this way. If I ran my business this way, I wouldn't have one! Oh and I forgot, apparently according to their accounting methods, me being without my services for four days total was only worth twenty dollars and considering I pay $150.00 for the bundle package, I think their math leaves much to be desired!"
"Yolanda of Houston, TX","May 22, 2010",0,"After having to reschedule several times within two weeks because techs failed to show up and customer service hung up on me, I refused the free movies option that the supervisor recommended and asked for a free month of service. I was granted the free month of service but then they retaliated by slowing down my internet, phone and cable services. Not only was I late for interviews, but this delayed my job search while waiting for techs. More importantly, that same week, my computer contracted a vicious Trojan virus entered my computer and damaged it completely. I never had viruses on my computer before this. I always had it very well protected. It’s just too coincidental. Now all I get is a box saying ""Access Violation to Module (numbers)"" with another box saying something about ending Comcast AntiSpy something.

I am paying a basic cable rate of 63 dollars for Comcast to make profits by removing real programming and put on shill advertising, much of which the producers of usually get convicted of fraud and larceny (See Kevin **). Why are they allowed to do this? They are charging us to selling us programming they are in return paid to air.There either has to be a reduction in rates equal to the amount they take in in paid programming or this programming must stop. In the worst economic crisis in the last 30 years, Comcast's profits were up nearly a billion dollars in late 2009. I do not begrudge a company making a profit but isn't this supposed to be similar to a public utility company. That's why we let them wire up the cities. The old Mayor of my hometown warned of this type of rampant abuse of the public trust, when cable first came to the City."
"Arif of Fremont, CA","April 29, 2010",0,"I signed up for the Comcast 3 bundled deal with a free netbook back in early August 2009, and till today I still have not received the free offer netbook Comcast promised.

The rep still have no records regarding the netbook, and asked me to check on checkmyrebate which left me nowhere either, since the check rebate site always was showing ""no records"". So on 01/10/10, I called Comcast and the 800 numbers on checkmyrebate, and still none of the reps have a clue or have info regarding when I'll be getting the netbook. Today, it's almost May 2010. Yet, I still have not gotten the netbook and none of the Comcast personnel can help, nor have info, nor have a clue regarding this offer. This is really getting frustrating and annoying. I really feel I'm being cheated by the Comcast free netbook offer just to get people signed up with them with a 24-month contract that you cannot break. I really believe this is really not a good business practice for such a big company like Comcast, and I really do hope someone could help me solve this issue along with the rest of the people that are having the same or similar complaint about Comcast online.

"Donald of Wilmington, DE","April 11, 2010",0,"Comcast is dishonest! Within a couple of weeks after my triple-play ""promotional rate"" of $141 ended, I called them to see if there were any other promotions I could get on. I was told there were by a rep from their ""Customer Retention"" division. He told me he would put me on a $122 (and change) rate, and it would be effective as of the end of my promotional rate.I also got a letter from Comcast, 2 days after that call saying that ""as a valued customer"", I would be getting at $10 triple-play credit for as long as I maintained my current level of service, and a $25 ""valued customer"" credit on every bill for the next 12 months. Turns out the total $35 credit reduced the ""regular"" charges to, guess what--$122! I thought I was getting a ""deal"", but it was no deal because I was just getting the reduced bill for being a ""valued customer"".But when the bill came, it was for $157. Called Comcast and was told that I was not on any new promotional rate. IOW, the rep lied or was incompetent and did not put me on the new rate. I mentioned the letter I had gotten from Comcast, and guess what the rep said? ""That letter was sent to you in error!"" At that point, I exploded, which I rarely do on the phone. After that, she said (again) that I was switched to the new promotional rate. But when I accessed my bill online, it was still just short of $157.Talked to another rep and was told that my new bill was $113.28. I asked if that's true, why does it still show $156 and change when I access it? She said the credit would show on the next bill. Bull feathers! As as result of this exchange, I terminated my auto-pay, which I've had for many years, to prevent Comcast from taking more out of my bank account than they're due. I instead sent them a check for the $113.28, which they cashed a couple of days ago and my account now shows a balance of $127 and change. In addition to the credits I was supposed to get, I had called a Comcast technician to investigate a problem with our TV reception. He arrived late, and told me there would be a $20 credit on my next bill. No such credit ever showed up."
"Susan of Midlothian, VA","March 17, 2010",0,"I originally came to this site to complain about MSN and/or My MSN changes but then found the Comcast complaints. I have never had a problem like any of the described issues in this thread. As a matter of fact, one tech that visited our home suggested that we sign up for a ""special"" they were running -- one year and only $.99 per visit. After this expired, I was able to negotiate another year for $1.99 each visit. Since we live in an older home, this has been well worth this small fee.I don't know if anyone has ever used ""Customer Retention"", but I use it every time our contract comes up for renewal. And did you know that if you see an advertisement for something even better, call them, ask nicely, and you might just get the new ""special"" and even extend it for one year. We have the triple play package right now and yes, the phone service isn't as good as Verizon. The tech admitted that to me but I have to say, it's getting better and better. We still kept our Verizon cell phones as it's the best coverage in our area.When we were having trouble installing the Apple Time Capsule (with a PC), I called the Comcast computer support number and asked if he could offer any suggestions. He went above and beyond and walked me through the whole process (even said ""now you're writing all this down, right -- several times).Yeah, we pay more than we think we should, but our only other choice in our area is Verizon Fios. In the community where we live, satellite dishes are prohibited so that's not an option. I can live with the small problems we have with the HD boxes since it usually just involves a re-set. Their new billing method is easy to read and understand. I've found that when I do have to call them, the nicer I am, the more cooperation I receive. I don't ever call any company with a complaint when I initially receive the bill. Giving myself time to review the issue(s) and have my facts straight means they usually treat me with the respect I deserve as a consumer. If they don't, then I nicely ask if this call could be recorded starting immediately. But that's just me. To begin, the way you go about making your complaint sets the tone for the ultimate outcome. Documentation is an absolute necessity."

"Laurel of Smyrna, TN","Feb. 19, 2010",0,"January 2010 we requested a Comcast sales person meet us at our home in order to determine if Comcast could help us reduce our current internet and phone providers from 2 to 1.Holly H. came to the house. Our request was to have a second modem installed that would have the primary house phone number and to hard wire my husband’s computer in order to access the internet. Our current service was Comcast TV, Comcast Digital phone and internet in a back office with a separate phone number from the primary house number.Holly indicated that this could be done at the additional monthly fee of $25.00; $20.00 for the additional line and $5.00 for a modem rental. This would also include an upgrade to the Economy T.V. package. On January 20th a technician came out to the house and told Jim, my husband, that our request could not be done. I contacted Holly who then contacted her supervisor. Between the two of them, they determined that our request was reasonable and doable. Holly had to replace the order.On February 2 another technician came out. He arrived exactly at 4:00 and said that our request could not be done. I immediately called Holly who then placed a call to her supervisor. The technician gave Holly his direct line and while it was waiting to hear he left for another call and we never heard from him again. I placed another call to Holly at 6:12 p.m. on February 2, asking for an update and she had none. I called Holly on February 3 at 10:07 a.m. asking for an update. She had none. She said she would call me by the end of the day. I did not hear from her. I called again on February 4 at 1: 24 p.m. and since I had still not heard from her I cancelled the order.During Holly's initial visit she explained that we will need a digital box to continue getting our current channels after Comcast goes digital and that two would be given free during the installation of our order. Since the order was never completed we did not receive the digital converter box. When I originally had the internet and digital voice installed in the back office we had Limited Basic TV service. The technician who installed these services told us that they would not work with Limited Basic TV service so he did whatever he needed to do which also resulted in us receiving additional channels without our payment changing. Since the new order was not completed and I did not want to lose the additional channels, I called Comcast on 2/16/2009 requiring about the digital converter box. Since our records showed that we only had Limited Basic service, the digital converter box was not necessary. I immediately talked to sales and told them the story about the original install of the internet and made arrangements to upgrade to the Economy Package. I spoke with Tiffany. She was going to mail the converter box and the Economy Package would be become effective until I had received the box. It would be coming by UPS and we'd have to sign for it. She said nothing about our existing service changing.I also shared with her our earlier problem. I told her that we were confused about who we could trust. She said we could trust the sales department. She also offered to talk to a colleague who had a connection with dispatch and she'd get back with me the evening of 2/16 to let me know the results. Was it really possible to have a 2nd modem and another computer hardwired for the internet? She never called me back. On 2/18/10 our channels have been reduced to the Limited Basic Service. I called sales and was told that because our account was coded for this level of service and that they were correcting a problem where homes in our area were getting channels, they were not paying for as a result of installing the digital hardware we were included in that corrective action. I was also told at this time that the converter box will take 3-7 business days to receive.As you can see our experience with the sales versus technician staff at Comcast has been a problem ever since we requested installation of internet and digital voice services. Sales says one thing, the technician another, Sales does not return phone calls; technicians leave a job yet because they were here before 4:00 p.m. The customer doesn't get the $100 for late shows, yet nothing is accomplished. Yet Comcast wants to be the preferred provider of cable, digital voice and internet services. "
"Kimberly of Lompoc, CA","Feb. 1, 2010",0,"I was a Comcast customer and fell a couple of payments behind. I didn't get a final notice, and they cut off my cable on January 22, 2010. I paid in full on January 27, 2010. After that, I received the final notice and noticed they didn't send it out until January 25, 2010. And it stated that the total was due by February 16, 2010 or my cable would be turned off. I find this to be bad business practices and am never doing business with their company again. "
"Anita of Puyallup, WA","Jan. 30, 2010",0,"I found my bill went up in Oct. 09, so I called. I was told very rudely that my ""specials"" were over. When I said it was wrong that ""new"" customers were given better deals, and their regular customers nothing, I was told very sarcastically that I was already paying less than many and there was nothing that could be done. In Dec. I was looking at my upcoming bill and saw it was being raised again. From Sept. to Jan. my bill went up $50 between the 2 increases. I also asked why I had a charge on the bill for ""blast"" speed, when that was not asked for, but was told by Comcast it was being given to their customers. Again, another entrapment, they ""give"" it to you for a period of time, then start charging.The store to return equipment is not conveniently located, and the wait is 45 minutes or more. Also, they owe me money and claim it is going to take 8 to 12 weeks. When I asked why so long, I got a cock and bull story about how the program is out of the area; it is only run once or twice a month, then has to be put into an envelope and mailed. Please, do they think we are stupid? Yes they do. With a bill of $170 a month, I got rid of Comcast, but feel their business practices are illegal. I spent a lot of time trying to reach them on the phone, and had to deal with rude people."
"Nathaniel of College Park, GA","Jan. 20, 2010",0,"The Comcast technician came out to my home on 1/19/10 to bury the cable that was exposed.  While doing so, they cut my phone line.  I advised the technician that they cut the line before they left and told me I had to call Comcast.  They set an appointment to the technicians to return today, 1/20/10, between 11am and 2pm.  No one showed up, no one called and when I contacted them again today, I got the run around including that I had to contact the local Comcast office at 404-266-2278 at 3620 Campcreek Pkwy Atlanta, GA.  It took four people to tell me that and when I did, they just said that people will come out until 8pm.  It gets dark at 6pm--more running around."
"Angela of Citrus Heights, CA","Dec. 17, 2009",0,"I have been a Comcast customer for almost six years only because they are the only cable company in my area. In the last year, I have had nothing but problems with their service and their customer service. At my apartment, it took six tech visits and four months for them to diagnose a problem and then explained that they could not fix it but they had no problem charging me for five of the visits. When I asked for a credit to my bill because I was without service or had partial services, they refused to credit my account. When I moved into my new home, they made me wait over a week to install services. Not totally their fault, but because I work from home, I lost out on wages due to my inability to be online. Yes, I know I could have gone somewhere to access public Wi-Fi, but that wasn't the point. Now that I have received my first bill, I am stunned to see that not only am I paying $40 more a month but I was nickel-and-dimed on everything. I signed up for a bundle service and it’s more? Upon calling, the representative was rude and could not help me even though they have a 30-day money back guarantee. I explained that I didn't feel that I was getting my money's worth and the guy had the audacity to tell me I was definitely getting my money's worth as if he has insight to my life and my financial situation. They have to be the worst company when it comes to value and customer service."
"Lloyd of Novato, CA","Dec. 5, 2009",0,"   My wife & I recently moved a short distance within the same city, and transferred our Comcast service to our new house, canceling the service at the old house simultaneously. When they installed equipment at our new house, they did not do a good job, and that is another nightmare story. But later, we also noticed that we were being double billed for both addresses for a month or two. After many hours on hold, we finally got a rep to tell us that it was their mistake, & that theyd send us a refund check, which we thought should be at least $200. We got a check for $20 and 84 cents, so we still figure were owed around $180. After many more attempts, and an online chat, Comcast said that I would have to visit the local Comcast office, which I did. I waited there another hour, & was amazed at the long line of angry customers, and only one customer service rep there to help people. Again, they agreed that we were owed money, and that theyd credit our account. Next month, we get our invoice with no such credit. If anyone knows of, or would like to organize a class action law suit against Comcast, wed be interested in seeing some justice!"
"Lydia of Brewster, NY","Nov. 15, 2009",0,   Comcast tells me with the exception of one channel change I can get the same cable tv service at a much discounted price (along with 1 year contract) but NOw I'm told that no! this is not available.

"Marci of Yuba City, CA","Oct. 15, 2009",0, I really hate to think that I must pay for a service I cannot use. Because it has become slow I'm having difficulties with my downloading. When it states I have no connection I feel as if I'm paying for a serice that is not up to par.
"Angelo of San Jose, CA","Sept. 19, 2009",0,"   As a long term user of COMCAST's extended basic analog service, I listened in 2008 when COMCAST advertised that there would be ""NO IMPACT"" to their subscribers when the analog to digital change occurred in 2009.  When the change occured, I incurred a significant amount of time, energy and frustration to receive less service than I had before. I am now forced to have COMCAST Equipment in my home and pay for service that was free before. I experienced a number of days of incomplete service when the digital system was not equivalent to the earlier analog.  I was charged for a service call by COMCAST to install an amplifier because the digital signal was NOT as strong as the earlier analog signal.  Complaints submitted to COMCAST web were not responded.  So I formally complain of COMCAST false and misleading advertising in 2008.

"Dan of Indianapolis, IN","Sept. 16, 2009",0,"What a mistake they were nothing like I thought for a internet provider. We always had service interruptions and slow speeds. Come to find out they had to take a trap off our line to be close to the speed that we were supposed to get and after a month they tried to charge us for more TV channels. The funny thing is we do not have any TVs in the house so finally after 3 months they removed the price difference but never gave is credit for it. Also if you do not pay them right away they turn you in to a credit service and trash your credit even if it was their mistake about the billing, I know this because it happened to me 7 times and even tho they issue was taken care of and yes a 7 times were errors on there side my credit is still tarnished from this to this day. Oh and by the way it was not like we were out in the sticks, we were located less than 6 miles from the main Comcast building.After 5 months those smart asses came back out and put the trap back on the line and did not tell us and flat out denied it when I asked them but I could see the trap on the cable up on the pole. After I told them that they were full of it they fessed up after about an hour. I was out of service for the total of 41 days in a 1 year time and many service glitches. It never would surprise me when I came home from work and found out that I had no internet. Finally in April 2008 we were pleased to find out that AT&T Uverse was available with high speed internet in my area.We called them and it was hooked up in less than 5 business days and running.

"Anjii of Richmond, VA","Sept. 12, 2009",0,"   Comcast was initially supposed to set up service in my home on 9/5/09 but due to the line in need of repair, they told me they needed to come at a later date. They scheduled me for 9/11/09 from 2p-5p for repair & installation of services (cable, phone, & internet). Friday morning, I returned home around 11:30a to find that one of the Comcast subcontracted techs had left a voicemail to notify me that he was going to be late. I was not aware that anyone was supposed to come out before my scheduled 2p-5p appointment. Another rep. from Comcast called, about 30 min. after the tech., to inform me that the tech was going to be late & that there was no ETA. I called Comcast to find out what was going on & was informed that a pre-wiring was scheduled for 8a-11a. No one had notified me before & that a pre-wiring needed to be done nor that an appointment from 8a-11a had been scheduled. It would not have mattered anyway, however, because the tech was late anyway; almost 2 hours late! The employee from Comcast, Cody, came as scheduled at 2p to proceed with the installation of services, but informed me that the pre-wiring had not been done & that he could not proceed without it. He called his supervisor & the supervisor of the subcontracted techs. He installed a temporary pre-wire (which meant running a wire through my sliding glass door with it being cracked open, leaving my home unsecure). He installed it this way with the underst&ing that another pre-wiring tech would come out by 5:30p the same day to fix the wire & install it correctly as per Natanya in the Richmond Comcast office. I paid $183.95 installation fee as per Comcast policy under the good faith that the services would be complete that day. Well, I waited until 5:30p & no tech had come. I called Comcast &, of course, the local office was closed so I spoke with several people in different call centers who could not get in contact with Comcast dispatch. They sent several emails to Richmond concerning the situation but I did not hear from anyone, a supervisor, until almost 10p. He informed me that he had just received the email as he had been in the field all day. I told him I appreciated him calling me back but was thoroughly disgusted with the type of service I received & that I did not wish to have services with them anymore. He stated that he would check to see why the tech never came to do the pre-wiring & get back with me.  I would like to know why no one ever came to complete the services & why did they ask me to pay money for services they knew were not going to completed that day. I have yet to recieve an answer from the Richmond office as they are closed on the weekends apparently. Their subcontractors are goign to cause them to lose money & customers. They need to rescind the contract with that company & hire a company who is going to do the job they are paid to do.

"Peggy of Brewster, NY","Aug. 27, 2009",0,"Comcast Cable is running a monopoly in my area. There is continuous poor service given by this company. I have heard it from everyone I know and there is nothing we can do about it! They are the only service provider in the area! Their service is horrible. They constantly set up service calls with 4-hour window and then don't show up or even call! What is a consumer to do with this? Why doesn't the government step in? If you google Comcast complaints, the lists are endless and there is nothing we, as the consumer, can do. They get away with it. This is a monopoly! Something has to be done. They raise their rates constantly and the service they offer keeps declining. It is not right! I was given a 12 to 4 pm window; this go around and no one showed up or called. From 4 pm until now, every telephone line in the local office is offline! They should be held accountable and a consumer should be given different companies to choose from."
"Teena of Boca Raton, FL","Aug. 24, 2009",0,"After years of terrible service and increasing monthly bills with misc. fees, taxes and charges, I have turned off my cable service. There must be a class action lawsuit against Comcast. They have all kinds of TV advertisements for special promotions that are never close to the amount billed. My area experiences numerous outages, yet the credits for downtime do not come close to the fees charged monthly. This monopoly must be broken."
"Gregory of Acworth, GA","Aug. 16, 2009",0,"I ordered this service 2 weeks ago for installation of a phone and cable jack in the office with DVR free for 6 months, regular box for the Master's bedroom, and basic for the 3rd room. When the tech entered my parent's home, he started by saying what he would not be able to do, not introducing his self or his company. We have a wireless router and wireless printer. He was not helpful in ensuring that all these were operational and was not the most helpful tech I have seen this company have. We are still needing assistance getting our fax/printer combo to function and would still like cable installed in this room. Once I signed off on the bill, I noticed charges that were not incurred during installation nor were these charges discussed at the time of ordering."
"Jo of Baden, PA","Aug. 12, 2009",0,"Comcast was enticing with their $99 triple play option, but I was skeptical because I had bad problems in the past with them. I spoke to Joe at **, extension ** and discussed my options. I wanted to be very careful because switching from DTV was going to cost me $120 early termination fee. Not only did I speak to him, but called him back with questions. I wanted full disclosure of the fees and my monthly bill, which Joe gave me. The bill came. The service was to the penny of what was disclosed, but wait a minute, what is this extra $5.81? I called and was told, ""Too bad. That's for rental of the modem."" Rental of the modem? I demanded it be taken off of my bill. I was also told, ""Too bad. Everyone pays that."" I asked for a supervisor. Same crap. I did a live chat with the company. I was told the same crap! Is that not the old bait and switch routine that is illegal? Yes, it is, but Comcast doesn't care. Now today, another issue I discussed with Joe, ESPN classic was removed from my line up and I will have to pay and extra $7.95 a month to get it back. Shame on you, Comcast. You are still the dirty birds I remember from the last time I hooked up with you. Now, I am stuck for two years. I have a feeling they won't come through on the rebate I was promised either."
"Senora of Suitland, MD","Aug. 10, 2009",0,"Each month after the initial start-up of $99 per month, the bill kept going up and up. The Triple Play Package (phone, tv, and internet) you chose had no meaning; they mislead you. They come back 3 months down the road to say they did not charge for the internet. Then later you find all of the charges and you call and call, and still no resolution. And they still charge more and think you are supposed to be good with it."
"Ted of Bolling AFB, DC","Aug. 9, 2009",0,"Wow, this site is great! This will be one of numerous complaints I file against Comcast. I am a really nice person and I could not be any angrier than I am currently. I moved on June 11th down the street and simply wanted to transfer my service over. On the first appointment, the technician said he did not have a long enough cable to complete the installation. I said I have one at the old house and will be back in 5 minutes. He said okay. When I came back, he was gone! I called support and they said the techs have to stay on a schedule, but they can reschedule the appointment. The next appointment I was ready for them and they didn't show up. I called and they said the tech called to say he was on his way and no one responded. I was in a place where I don't have signal, but I would have been home at the appointment time for the entire window. The third time the guy simply didn't show - no call, no nothing. I called support and without apology they said they don't know why nobody came, but all they can do is reschedule me. I asked for a supervisor and they hung up on me. I immediately ordered DirecTV and that has been installed successfully - the first time! But there’s still no internet. I made another appointment since Comcast has a monopoly on internet here and they finally came about 2 weeks later. Three weeks for the first appointment date I got internet. Then, I got my bill and it showed that my request for cable cancellation had not been received and they decided to start charging me for renting their modem, which I never did. I called 1-800-Comcast and they said it was the wrong department and transferred me to Maryland. Maryland said since I lived in DC I would need a different number, and for some reason I got transferred to NY! They said sorry and transferred me back to 1-800-Comcast who finally got me to the cancellations department - after 4 hours of holding and transferring! The cancellations department said everything was fixed. Then I got another bill - no changes. I went for the live chat and after doing that for an hour she said, “It's all fixed. Ha-ha-ha.” I just got my bill: $236.10. Nothing has been fixed. The modem’s still on there. There are no payment credits, no missed service credit, the cable still being charged, and the internet is not prorated for June. And there are some late fees! I just contacted live support again. They said there is nothing they can do, but a supervisor will be contacting me soon. Yeah, right, I'm not holding my breath."
"C. of San Francisco, CA","July 24, 2009",0,"I subscribed to Comcast at $64.06/month. This monthly charge has consistently increased over the years although the quality of channels offered has not. What I am complaining about more than the channel offerings is that Comcast devotes a large chunk of channels to infomercials between either 11:30PM or midnight, up to 7AM the following day. I have complained directly to them about why since beginning of July, they have extended the infomercial time slot through 7AM on a channel I used to be able to watch beginning at 6AM prior.The Comcast rep told me that I must go in person to the local Comcast office and place my complaint since it's a local issue. This is unacceptable to me and solves nothing. In my opinion, the Comcast rep could have forwarded my email complaint to the local office. But the main issue is how could Comcast get away with occupying so many channels with infomercials? I and other clients are paying for the ability to watch these channels and it's not fair that Comcast derives profits from the infomercials while we are at the mercy of Comcast as to when and what we can watch. Thank you."
"Rodolfo of San Carlos , CA","July 23, 2009",0,"The appointment with Comcast to repair my cable access was scheduled from 2pm to 4pm on 7/23/2009. Comcast did not show up, so at 4:10pm I called to find out why. It took quite awhile to get an answer, but they eventually said the tech called at 3:30pm. I learned that my appointment was now canceled because I did not answer the tech's call at 3:30pm. I wasted 2 hours off work waiting on Comcast. And they never did show up. Poor tech service and even bad to worse customer service. I would not recommend Comcast to anyone."
"A of Atlanta , GA","July 7, 2009",0,"I have tried to set up Internet with Comcast for more than a week now. They are insisting that they need to send someone out to the high-rise I live in, in order to restart the service. However, when I had first moved to the area (and into the same building) the service was started over the phone since I had a Comcast modem and router already. Amazing how 6 months later, I can't find 1 competent customer service person to put in the request to restart the service. They have given me 4 different dates to start the service and yet 1 week later, I still don't have service.I have spent 3 hours on the phone with them and was told that the manager, Forest **, is in an all day meeting and has no replacement. Unfortunately, in the neighborhood that I live in Atlanta, GA, there is no alternative internet service provider, either Comcast or no internet. Furthermore, the consumer protection agency in GA is largely nonexistent and they won't process the complaints they've been receiving regarding Comcast."
"Sid of Fremont, CA","June 30, 2009",0,"Comcast offered a great deal to switch my TV programming from DirecTV to Comcast Digital Cable. When they signed me up, we chose Digital Starter pack with 40 HD channels that included CNN HD and PLD HD, among others. Little that we realize that their service and equipment would be extremely pathetic. They set us up with an HD box with DVR that would literally hang at least 4-5 times a day and would need cold boot every time. Today, 6/29/09, we decided to lug the bulky box to the local Comcast service station in Fremont and got a replacement. When we set up the replacement box today, we no longer received the HD programming line-up that was promised to us as part of the Digital Starter pack (which we locked for one year through a contract, by the way). When I got on the phone and waited for 20 minutes, I gave up and got on a chat session instead. The chat session support person named Ronald told us that I will have to upgrade my package in order to get the HD programs that I until a couple of hours ago (i.e. before exchanging my cable box, which was due to Comcast's bad equipment and not due to our volition) we were receiving. The service support person would be of no help in restoring our programming and directed us back to a 1-800 number to again go through the ordeal. This has resulted in extreme frustration, mental agony and pain. Comcast charges us for the services and then decides to change terms without letting us know. And if a consumer does that, they will slap us with large fees for ""violating the contract.” This is totally unacceptable. In my profession, I have to rely on business and other world news. I had to miss all that because I spent hours trying to resolve a situation that was a result of bad and unethical practice of Comcast. It is tough to quantify the economic implications of such deeds of large corporations."
"Shawna of Pitttsburg, CA","June 20, 2009",0,"We paid our Comcast service and 2 days after we paid, we were hit with a late fee. We have severe outages that has killed our TV and had no cable for 1 month and we were still required to pay for service they couldn't fix for over a month and had to buy a new TV as a result of their cable not being grounded. To top it all off, they're the only cable company out here. They won't allow another cable company to come out to my city. As I rent, I am forced to have Comcast if I want to watch TV! I thought that a business can not hold a monopoly on a service in CA so that people could have a choice! But not where I live."
"Michael of Muskegon, MI","June 14, 2009",0,"My internet connection and or my cable TV connection have gone out a total of eight times in the last five weeks. Each time, Comcast has sent out a repair person at their convenience, while I get to change my schedule to accommodate theirs, who temporarily fixed it and have plenty of excuses to explain why it won't happen again. They have included the wiring is old and needs to be replaced. The other techs used a technique called ""boot and scoot"" which was explained to me to mean they just splice in a piece of wire and get out as fast as possible. One tech added an amplifier, another removed the amplifier. Another tech told me the modem was bad so I bought a new one. Then I found out that there wasn't anything wrong with the first one but I can't return a modem once it has been opened because it's an electronic item. Another time they sent out a person to disconnect my neighbor because he switched to a satellite network but disconnected mine instead. The excuses, incompetence and breakdowns keep coming but the reliability does not.When I call in, I'm always, without exception, put on hold. During this time, Comcast has the nerve to play recorded messages telling how I'm a highly valued customer and all about the great shows I could be watching if my connection worked. The best part is they also play commercials telling me about other premium channels and services I can sign up for that won't work either but that I can pay more money each month.I’ve been a customer for over twenty years and yet I get treated like someone whose business they don't need. Maybe that's what I need to do. Three of my neighbors have switched from Comcast to a Dish Network because of their lack of service. I think I will be next but not before I write an editorial to my local newspaper, the college newspaper where I work, the Better Business Bureau, The County Cable Franchise Commission and I purchase a full page of space in the newspaper as well just to make sure everybody gets to see this. I also intend to post this message on any and every internet site that might have an interest in it. I will also look into any state offices that might have an interest in your incompetent performance.Here's a surprise! While writing this, my cable connection dropped out again. That brings the count up to nine times in five weeks. "

Since May 22 wire has been unburied exposed wrapped around our home in Evergrene with no date to bury the eye sore and safety hazard with 4 small kids in our home until June 12.  The Comcast representative that drapped the wire on May 22 had told us he would be out the next week to bury the wire.  I have spoken over 8 times to request burial with the Comcast representatives being uncooperative.  22 days for incomplete work to be completed and leave expose wiring above grown is both unreasonable and unsafe!  Comcast was unwilling to provide an earlier date to bury. I am concerned for my 4 small children as this wire is around their playground and the parameter of our property. Please help. 
"Greg of Vacaville, CA","May 15, 2009",0,My cable service doesny work. I had 3 techs out. The first one didn't show up. The second one was late by a hour. The thrid was late too. The manager showed late. And did some work. But I still have the same problems. The now wont call me back. I'm paying for service Im not getting. I can't watch TV.  
"Tracey of District Heights, MD","May 7, 2009",0,"Unfortunately, I had another matter in the home that required my presence at home. I needed to leave work anyway and figured the cable tech would be arriving around 4:50 like they normally do. 
When 4:50 approached and I hadn't received the courtesy call, I decided to call Comcast to make sure my appointment was scheduled still. The representative, Tammy, verified all of the information and said that the tech still had ten minutes to arrive. She provided me a ticket # of and the technician number (Errol M). So, I waited. I called again at 5:10p because the tech still had not arrived.
I spoke to representative #2, Candace who didn't have an ID# but worked in the Silver Spring, MD office with Carleen as her supervisor. She confirmed that the tech was running late and I asked her to verify that he had the correct number, which he did. I requested that the tech contact me via phone to provide me with an ETA. She said that she would note the account and ask that the tech call me directly, which the tech never did.
I called again at 5:50p and spoke with representative #3, Gerald W located in Silver Spring. He noted that the tech acknowledged receipt of the ticket 1203108 and indicated at 5:30p that I was next. I asked Gerald why tech --- did not call to let me know and estimated time of arrival. Gerald said that he was unsure and could ask a supervisor to call him and have the tech contact me with an ETA. He asked to place me on hold. I held for about eight minutes and the call was disconnected.
I called back to complete the inquiry from the previously failed call and spoke to representative #4, Dwayne S located in Largo. He indicated that the tech had left the last job and would be on his way to me in ten minutes. I requested that a supervisor contact me and Dwayne informed me that I would be called in an hour. The supervisor NEVER called.
Because I know that Comcast is NEVER true to the time frames that THEY create, I understand that they will JUST beat the end time for the service call to avoid the $20 credit to the customer. However, my issue (other than him arriving at 6:23p and never apologizing) was that there was never a call to confirm when he would arrive despite my numerous attempts requesting this information. Not to mention that when I first set up the service call on 5/3, I specifically asked for the technician to call me 30 minutes prior so I could leave work to meet them there.When the tech arrived, it took him all of ten minutes to correct the problem. Apparently a different comcast technician accidentally disconnected service to my home instead of another residence. Wow.I'm unsure why Comcast insists on providing substandard service at overcharged prices. What are the other alternatives? I prefer cable over having a huge satellite drilled into my roof. However, Comcast is the only one to service Maryland. I am fed up with Comcast's practices and I would like to see some results regarding this matter that happens over and over and over and over again.

"Christine of Chesapeake Beach, MD","May 4, 2009",0,"   My husband is home on vacation this week and he is finally getting to see how lousy Comcast is!  I complain to him about it all the time, but he never gets to see it.  The TV is pixeling, the phone doesn't work, all the things I have told him about he is finally getting to see first hand!"
"Jennifer of Aurora, CO","April 3, 2009",0,"Well, as of today I have had two horrible experiences with Comcast. I've been with Comcast since 07/2008. Two months ago I had a chatting session with one of Comcast's representatives over upgrading my service. She gave me all this hoopla on how because I pay my bills before due date, I would get all these great deals and free promotions. Later the same day, I thought it must be too good to be true. I went online to confirm all these wonderful deals. Of course, the man had no idea. Thank God I copied and pasted the entire conversation! Well, I was P.O. of course. I informed the representative about what took place and pasted him the conversation, as well as sent the entire conversation to the FCC with a complaint. But don't get me wrong, he went above and beyond to keep me as a customer.Then, I just moved to my first home and transferred my service, and kept my box from my last place. I am unable to access On Demand (Error 4). I called this time and a gentleman who seemed tired said he will reset it, and to wait 30 minutes. I wait and guess what happened next? On the second call, I got some woman with a condescending attitude. I tried to have her just reset my box and fix the On Demand. Well, we went from the problem with my box to my billing issues (note that I had received promotional deals 2 months prior), stating that I should be paying $15 for my box, but I am only paying a fraction. I informed the woman (customer service) that I have a promotional deal. She stated that because I have a DVR-HD box (I've had this box since service started), I am being charged for just the HD. Why am I going over with the type of box that was given to me at the time I started service? She would not let up, stating I got off for months, like I was robbing them from the get-go.  I asked for a supervisor. Well, she came back on saying, ""I spoke to my supervisor and we will cut the price,"" which is more than what I am paying now. My bill is already more than what it should be. I finally got a supervisor who sounded just like the representative. She was not trying to help, either. I just said that I did not call to go over my bill (mind you I pay my bill the first of the month, every month), I called to get my box reset so I can enjoy the On Demand that I am paying for! I got it done, but for some odd reason she was so quick to set up an appointment for a service man to come and visit. Why? Can you or can you not reset my box?All in all, I am ready to settle for a dish. I felt so belittled and upset by the hour that was wasted just to fix the box. Thanks Comcast! FYI, my second letter to the FCC and State Attorney General's office will be sent. There needs to be some type of policy or procedure that your customer service center should take on manners and respect towards customers who will be loyal to your company in the future."
"Rick of Marietta, GA","March 24, 2009",0,"COMCAST has the worst Customer Service of any company I know. You go on their web site an can only find how to buy stuff, not information about their services, their programming, or even a contact to complain to... I have tried to find out what Basketball games would be televised in my area and can't find anyone who knows. I did find one customer service rep who talked to everyone she knew within COMCAST and could not find an answery so she called ESPN. Horay!!! but they didn't know what COMCAST would televise in my are only that they were broadcasting it. When you can get someone to come out to fix a problem they quote we will be there sometime between 8AM & 5PM, so you take the day off an they don't arrive until 6PM to tell you they can't fix it but you will be on the Top of their list the next day????? Why not today????"
"M of Suwanee, GA","March 18, 2009",0,"I received a call(3/18/2009) from the Comcast equipment department saying I still had equpment for them I had already returned in July 2008.  I moved from that location over 9 months ago and I am not sure I can find the receipt.  I called the customer service office to find out why I was on this list.  Allan, a Customer Service rep answered the phone, he was very rude,did not want to help to look up my information.  I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor and he then put me on hold for over 5 mins.  When he came back and I asked him why I was not transfered to someone else, he said was looking for the phone number for the corporate office as I requested.  I told him I did not ask for any such information,  I asked why he was being so rude and if he did not want to help me he could have just transfered me to someone else.  He said to do that, I would have to hang up and call back.  I told him he was not being very he rude about this incident.  He said he was the best Rep they had there.  I beg to differ, left that call not getting any assistance.I had to call back to speak with another Customer Service rep, who was very helpful, looked up the information on my account and saw I owed no equipment, she made a notation on my past account and advised me to call the Equipment Department to let them know of that I was not liable for any information.  I did that.  Why couldn't it be that easy with my inital call, I wasted 30 mins of my life and had to make additional calls for information I should have received in the first place."
"Bill of Bedford, NH","March 6, 2009",0,"Set up to get bundle package and was told by customer service that I would get the same channels.  Tech came to the house but Comcast had not set aside the correct amount of time to trunk over the phone line from Fairpoint, so they gave me a temporary phone number This was incorrect procedure, so they had to cancel my current work order and initiate a NEW work order, thus making me wait 9 more days.  The tech unhooked everything and did notre-establish the phone line in our bedroom, plus we now didn't have The Movie Channel. I called and they kept mtransferring me to the phone tech who told me I would have to wait until my appointment. They showed up in the AFTERNOON, even though I specifically took time off work in the am, so had to RE-SCHEDULE again.  When all iis said and done, I was told The Movie Channel WAS NOT part of the package.  When i complained, the customer service rep REFUSED to let me speak to a superior and I was hung up on TWICE. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR POOR SERVICE. Once I get Fios in my neighborhood, I will switch and be done with Comcast for good.Missed 2 days work"
"Susan of Pasadena, MD","March 4, 2009",0,"After waiting a 6 weeks for comcast to set up the home phone in my new house (they had come out earlier, but had not set it up correctly), I got my new phone number in January 2009.  I gave the number to no one, since I use my cell.  I never filled out a form with the phone number.  Only Comcast knows the number and the name that goes with it.  In the past 4 weeks, I have rec'd sales called, repeatedly.  When I called Comcast to complain that they sold my name and number, I asked that I be given a new number that was not sold.  I was told there was a fee to get a new number and there was no way to guarantee that the information would be kept confidential."
"Patricia of Monmouth Junction, NJ","March 3, 2009",0,"I was having problems with getting Cable On Demand and a technician came out to resolve the problem on 12-5-08.  After over an hour in my home unable to resolve the problem he went outside and ran what he called a temporary line, which was an orange cable that he ran across the front of my home, which includes my front door. I started calling Comcast Mid December and have been calling them ever since to have them come an run the cable the correct way but they have not done so.  They told me they had to contact the utility companies because they had to mark the area so that they can bury the line, however, they told me this back in December and again in January. The Cable poses a safety hazard as well as being unsightly.  I tripped on the cable about a month ago and my 82 year old dad tripped on the cable last week coming into my home.  The last time I called cable was on 2/26/09 and after waiting on hold for about 45 minutes waiting to speak with a supervisor, he told me someone would come out on Sat 2/28, they never came. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Comcast and I'm at my wits end trying to get this problem resolved and feel helpless and frustrated. I'm hoping you can help me get this problem resolved and look into the way Comcast treats their customers. I'm sure I'm not the first customer that has experienced the run around that Comcast has given me over the last 3 months but I hope it's the last and that Comcast has a higher authority to answer to.  Thank you for any assistance you can give me with this matter.I'm thankful that neither myself nor my dad were hurt when we tripped on the cable, but I don't want to wait for something bad to happen.  I'm extremely stressed over this situation."
"Clement of Federal Way, WA","Feb. 23, 2009",0,"I called to complain about the hike in my bill...I was paying $97.24 a month for Cable TV & Internet Service, they raised the payment to $131.93. They said I was getting a 6 month reduction & my time had run out. I told the young lady that I was thinking of disconnecting my Comcast & going with a dish network.

Very poor customer relations. Little effort to meet my customer needs. Arrogant. Very irritating. Unable to obtain IP address nor any helpful response. No suggestions, nothing."
"Former of Dickinson, ND","Feb. 11, 2009",0,"I am enjoying reading the complaints below - I wholeheartedly agree with each and every one of you. I myself am a former employee - let me just clue you guys in on a few things:This company price gouges because they can (the whole monopoly status is pegged right where it should be). You get such poor service because people like me can't take it anymore (no offense guys, I really empathize with you). You call in to complain to another of many reps for a specific problem, you get to me and belittle, berate, cut me down so low, don't let me get a word in, refuse my help, and yell a slur of obscenities at me - of course I will shut down, I won't help you and I will give bad info to get back at you (since the company won't let us hang up, we are forced to take the abuse) - it's all I can do. The morale at work is so low and turnover so high since we are forced to deal with something the company could easily fix by spending a little money.We have to go through a 2-month training before we ever make it to the call center floor (we study really hard, and when you get to the floor you're told to forget everything you learned) so now I'm stuck in training all over again and you get angry since I don't know what I am doing now. They don't care - if they did sites like this wouldn't exist. They get the money, give you bad service and sit back on their boot heels laughing it up thinking of new ways to make money (trying a cell phone venture, they already purchased air space) when they can't even get 3 little services right!!I am really sorry, and I am the first to apologize about what happens when you call - I used to be the sweetest person, but when the company gives you tools to help customers and then tells you -""Oh I think you need to do it this way instead,"" and ""Oh, by the way we're grading your call (yup all calls were graded and your job depended on it)"" and ""You have to push to sell more products even if they have issues with one that you can't fix (why do I want to sell you a crap product if the one you originally called about doesn't work - what kind of faith are you going to have in my service).""When you call just remember what I told ya - don't fault the person on the phone (unless they are just brain dead) people like me were so mentally abused by customers that we didn't want to do our jobs - exercise a little patience - I jumped through hoops for people that were kind to me...but if you were a jerk I shut down and made their life just as miserable as you made mine. These poor people answering phones are constantly told conflicting things, badgered by call center higher-ups, and belittled by customers - give 'em a small break.I completely agreed with all the frustrations. They were pretty accurate judging by what went on in my area - I do apologize for the company as a whole since they are pretty pathetic. Keep on writing the BBB, doing letter campaigns, starting websites - they will eventually get it (that is how Comcrap came across Twitter.com where customers went to rant and rave and really improved on some people). Just remember that no matter how big they are that they will eventually fall with the bad practices that they have."
"Mae of Clovis, CA","Feb. 1, 2009",0,"I discontinued my cable service with Comcast in October 2008. I've called numerous times to get my refund of $37.38. It has been one person after another telling me that the check is in the mail, but as of 1-31-09, nothing has been received. I would like to know why it's so difficult for a company, such as Comcast to respect a previous customer's request for money owed to them. I just want what is due to me just as Comcast always wanted me to pay them in a timely manner."
"Lora of Washington, NJ","Jan. 27, 2009",0,"On 12/1/2008, I ordered service from Comcast. However, on 12/5/2008, I decided that I could not afford the service. Comcast owes me $163.95 which I have been trying to get back from them and they have not refunded my money that is owed to me. I have spoken to several representatives, who promised me that my check was mailed on 12/15/2008. As of 01/26/2009, I have received nothing from Comcast. Their phone # is 800 266-2278.

"Kathy of Fairfax, VT","Jan. 24, 2009",0,"Comcast (again!) is raising rates and deleting services. Am on the phone with Dan (1/24/09, about 3:58 pm). No longer have local on-demand channel, suddenly taken away with no notice. Have checked bills, nothing listed. Getting rid of on-demand channels to free-up bandwidth on Comcast system. Implemented one month early with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE, but quick to include rate increase! Can the government start to control this ridiculous behavior, now that we have someone normal in the presidency? When is Comcast going to be held accountable for their deceptive practices?"
"Michael of Carteret, NJ","Jan. 22, 2009",0,"I moved from South Jersey to North Jersey in November and I was informed that as long as I get triple play at my new residence, I would not be charged the $150 term fee. My account has now been sent to collections even though I have spent numerous hours on the phone explaining this situation. Everyone at Comcast agrees with me but no one will help me. As requested, I have sent copies of my new Comcast statements showing that I have the bundle package and still no response."
"Brenda of Waterbury, CT","Jan. 13, 2009",0,"I asked Comcast if I could reduce my services with the company. I have a bundle package which includes Cable, phone and Internet. The company said that I would be able to adjust the package to a price I would be able to afford but they will charge me a $150 cancellation fee. I was not canceling their service, I only needed a better-priced plan. Is this legal?"
"Clyde of Wilmington, DE","Jan. 4, 2009",0,"We bought a HD TiVo box that required a cable card that Comcast had to issue. When I called to get the card, I told them that I did not have our old cable box anymore. Comcast quickly told me that they would still charge me for the box even if we didn't use it (i.e., we weren't allowed to return it). I reminded them that the FCC had an agreement with the cable companies where the cable companies would provide one card for free to consumers. By charging me for a box we won't use, they are charging me for the card which seems illegal.I wish that was the end. After a technician came, he tried to convince us to let him take the box since we wouldn't need it knowing we would still have to pay for it. That was easy to deal with but when he was done, he said the cable card was working fine and left. When we turned on our TV, the card wasn't initialized or paired so we had no signal. After 3 days of phone calls to Comcast with each rep telling us the card was fine, we still have no TV. We are now waiting for a rep to come to our home which won't happen for at least 2 days. Oh, and I almost forgot; the rep scratched our new Ethan Allen entertainment center."

When I first quesitoned the bill they told me that there was another person in the area with the same name and the charges were going on my bill. They told me to just pay the bill minus the movie charges. Well now that I have moved into a different house the charges are continuing! I called again and now they tell me that the bill is based on ss # not name and they are trying to make me pay this bill!I removed the cable box that they say the movies are being bought from and returned it to the comcast office. Well miraculously there are 3 new charges for movies coming from the other cable box in the living room. 
"Pamela of Wallington, NJ","Dec. 27, 2008",0,"I was a customer of Comcast since 1995. In October of this year the management of my complex decided to have Verizon Fios boxes installed in all dwellings, Verizon then offered promotions to sign with them. I called Comcast to inquire about switching since they provided phone, internet, and cable, I wanted a smooth transition. i was told I did not have a contract and how to go about releasing my number to Verizon. On average my bill was over 200 dollars per month with Comcast. I switched to Veizon on Oct. 23, 2008, and now Comcast is billling me for an early temination fee. They state I have a contract until April 2008, even though I was told I did not and I really don't know what kind of contract since as I stated my bills averaged $210.00 per month. They will not listen to reason, first I was a good paying customer for 13 years in this complex and another 10 in another, Comcast was the only act in town. Now that we have a choice and managements wants all tenants to go with Verizon, Comcast is trying to squeeze every cent from the people that leave. I will never have their service again, and I am fighting the ETF, it is unjust!"

I called the next day to confirm. I was told Comcast does not provide service in my area. The modem arrived two days later. My credit card was charged $89.99 for a modem that I cannot use and a service that I cannot have. I have been trying to return this modem for over 2 months. Noone at Comcast or Broadband would help me get my money back. Tomorrow, I will take the modem that is still its box to the post office and pay for retuning it back to the address that came from. I am hoping that someone in Broadband office in Georgia will come to relize that they charged me for something I cannot utilize because Comcast failed to notify me that they do not provide service in my area. I would like someone to contact me with an advice how I should proceed in this matter.  I am still out the $89.99 that I paid for the modem. I need my money back!"
"Teresa of Hendersonville, TN","Nov. 23, 2008",0,"For the last few weeks, everytime the Comcast ad comes on my Yahoo mail page, I'm kicked off line. It's like they have control of my account, which is with Bell South & just want me to look up & see their ad. As if, I'd change back to them. Such aggravation, but I don't know who to complain to. It's not Yahoo's fault, or Bell South & I don't have a Comcast account. I can't find any way to contact Yahoo to tell them & see if they can quit selling ad space to Comcast. I'm trying to do my little selling business on ebay & this is a big distraction when I'm in a hurry. Even reading my mail can be a problem with the internet going down over & over. Is this a common complaint? Could someone let me know?"
"David of Fallston, MD","Oct. 29, 2008",0,"I also have Comcast cable. In the last year, my signal quality has deteriorated significantly. I get out-of-sync, and dropouts. Many service visits have failed to fix the problems. Comcast service techs admit that the problem is with TV, internet and phone on the same cable, Comcast is delivering lower a lower quality signal.Also, Comcast has dropped at least 2 stations from their analog list and moved them the the digital list. I will not benefit from the digital conversion!I am paying more for less from Comcast and in Feb. 2009, I will be FORCED to pay for bad reception and reduced listings."

"Beth of Houston, TX","Oct. 22, 2008",0,"I am a customer of Comcast Cable. I became a customer because of the sweet deal they were offering to come on board. $250 dollars in rebates. Since I began my service, I have had nothing but very bad encounters with Customer Service its as if they are paying me to be a member of there network, but the truth of the matter is that I am paying them to treat me like I was dirt under there finger nails. The Customer Service is so bad, I suffer from headaches after a long hurry up and wait call with Comcast and the sad thing about it is they never resolve the issue... Comcast has hang up in my face...blind transferred me in the middle of a conversation, yell at me as if I was a child, refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor, lied to me about my contract.This list just goes on and on. I have never received my REBATE COMCAST..and they disconnected my service after I made a payment. I have not gotten a credit for all the time my cable was off due to Ike and they have decided to charge me for services in advance rather I like it or not.. I never agreed to this. I HAVE BEEN LIED TOO. And I am burning mad about it. I called the main office and talk to Lisa and was promise that they would call me back today to resolve my issues. HELLO LISA STILL WAITING. Comcast is a Joke. That poor customer service team is going to run the company in the ground. Oh by the way my phone is still off.. I am just...this is nothing but a nightmare... I just want to wake up. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST IF AT ALL POSSIBLE."

"Julie of Parker, CO","Sept. 1, 2008",0,"   My mom had basic cable for years because that's all she could afford. About a year ago, I started paying for her cable and upgraded her to a better package so she could watch things like cnn and the weather channel.For the past year, we've had nothing but problems with comcast.  To begin with, in order to upgrade her services, Comcast said that it had to come out to the house and install new cable boxes.  They gave my mom a specific time and day, and my mom had to take a half day off of work for that.They were supposed to be there between noon and 5 p.m.  What happened was that they came at 11 a.m., worked only on the outside box, never left her a note or called her to tell her that they were on their way or there or what they had done.  She called 3 different times to Comcast to ask why they hadn't arrived (after 5 p.m.).  Only with the 3rd person did she find out what happened.  The other two said that there was no listing of anyone showing up.  They then tried to walk her through the tv setup process with the remote control, which my senior citizen mom had trouble with (they should have done this before they left). Finally, it all got to working, but my mom was a mess by the time it was done.  Not only that, but it turned out that she didn't really need to be there and didn't have to take time off of work.  So right there they cost her a half-day's pay. Then, over the past 8 months my mom has had periodic issues with the cable just going out.  Twice there have been cable guys to come and look, and while initially they say that her tv is broken, before they leave they figure out that it's their cable box on top of the tv.The first time it happened they replaced her cable box with an older, refurbished version.  That one broke within 4 months.  They then came back out, tried to tell her it was the tv again, til they figured out it was the cable box, and then replaced the refurbished model with a new one.  That worked fine til a month ago.  Now the tv is having the same problem and she has called several times to customer support to get help.  Half of the time she gets people who don't speak english clearly and she ends up not getting any help at all.  When she does talk to someone who speaks english well, they try to tell her that it sounds like her tv is broken (yet again).They've told her more than a few times over the phone that she needs a new tv, rather than send another cable guy out there to diagnose the real problem.  My mom and I are done.  I refuse to pay the $58/month for this kind of service and product, and my mom is tired of not being able to watch tv.  We just ordered Directv for her and it's going to be installed on Saturday.  It will be a great satisfaction to cancel the comcast account.

While they were here, their technicians disconnected my AT&T data line and took the barrel connector so I could not reconnect it. A few other people on my street actually had their cables capped with physically locked terminators.

"Rodney of Midlothian, VA","Aug. 13, 2008",0," I have sinced called 4 other times with no conclusion at all. I finally did receive a credit from Mary (employee # 24464) for 1 of the HDTV boxes which she was able to see I never had. But that is it. They still will not take off the 1 HDTV box and the HDTV service, they also mentioned that if I want them to come pick up this box they will charge me. This is very frustrating. I only ordered triple play for 99.00 so this is all I should be responsible for and I should not have to pay for them to come pick up this HDTV box and give me the box they were originally suppsoe to give me anyway.

"Dave of Spring, TX","Aug. 10, 2008",0,"About a year ago Time-Warner transferred it's cable (Internet) franchise to Comcast in the Houston area. At that time we (subscribers) were given to believe that the transfer would NOT affect current service contracts. I had Road-Runner Lite (a lower speed broadband connection at a lower cost) at the time. Comcast continued to bill for this service without change until recently. Now they've bumped my bill significantly. When I queried Comcast they maintain that I was on a six month promotional service which was now converting to regular service. This is a lie (Comcast has been providing, and billing, for service for ONE YEAR under the original Road Runner Lite service contract). I have had NO COMMUNICATION from Comcast during the past year to indicate that there has or would be any change in my service agreement (to the contrary, as I indicated, when the service was changed over we had assurances of NO CHANGES to the service). Comcast has arbitrarily, capriciously, spuriously, maliciously and WITHOUT any notice whatsoever to subscribers decided to change the terms of service to it's customers. Comcast has a TOTAL MONOPOLY in this part of the State of Texas for Cable service (some parts of Houston have alternatives, we do not). This completely unconscionable. Cost of service has increased 20% WITHOUT any warning or advanced notice."

Comcast DOES NOT tell you this when selling the DV.  In addition, your safety is compromised if someone (thief or worse) cuts your cable line.  Your alarm will ring but your monitoring system WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED that there is a problem.  Comcast will tell you if the power or cable TV goes out, your phone switches to a battery modem for phone service, thus your alarm monitoring is not interrupted.  But they don't tell you if someone cuts the cable line to your home you are NOW at the mercy of the buglar or WORSE.

Like we should have reported to them that they made a mistake and gave us more programs that we paid for.  After dealing with very arrogant Comcast employees and continously disappointing unavailable internet connections, we decided to swith to SBC Yahoo (now AT&T).  *** Disconnection: July 2008 ****  Imagine being called after 9pm on your cell phone from the cable guy asking you to QA whether the cable got disconnected!

Comcast is not acknowledging that the problem lies with them although it's evident it does.AT&T,Access Integrated Network and Comcast agree that the problem is a translation problem.  I can't see why they can't get the problem resolved.We have many customers who call our place of business with inquiries about our products or to order something from us.

"Judith of Queeche, VT","June 16, 2008",0,"My girlfriend has been refused contact with customer service supervisors.  Her service was disconnected accidentally by a COMCAST service person.  She called and a representative restarted her service, however, her high speed internet was not connected as well as she was charged as if she was being connected for the first time.  Everytime she calls now, she is put on hold and then disconnected and refused service.  As I am a comcast customer as well, I think it is totally unacceptable that she was refused contact with a supervisor. She cares for a woman and it puts strain on her schedule to take days off waiting for a comcast technician that doesn't show up - as was the case today(6/12/2008).  also takes classes online and not having internet access is affecting her class performance.  9-year old son has a brain disease called Chiari Malformation and utilizes the internet to feverishly research the disease and any experts that may be available to help in the treatment of her son.   Bottom line, I would like Rick Germano - SVP COMCAST customer support, to contact personally and please re-assure her that this issue will be resolved and the process of rectifying her service and faith that her voice as a COMCAST customer will be heard.   I would like to know if there is any legal recourse she can take to offsett her loss of pay as a result of waiting for a comcast service representative who does not show up to rectify her service."
"Janet of Falmouth, MA","June 4, 2008",0,"I live in a senior complex.  When Adelphia Cable was the main cable company, the seniors received a reasonable discount.  $10. for Basic and $15. for Standard.  Now with Comcast in, (with no competitors) we are at their mercy.  Seniors are paying the going prices.  But yet, another senior complex in the same town is being charged the discounts as described above. The seniors are on a fixed income, living in the State of Massachusetts with extremely high costs of living.  I call this discrimination. For $14.95, the seniors can get Basic cable, which consists mostly of home shopping channels, spanish speaking channels and local stuff.  The other senior complex is not even 1/2 mile from this one.  Comcast is a multi-million dollar outfit, but yet they are closing their eyes to being consistent with the seniors here in this town.  The mental anguish is enough!"

However as soon as Comcast took over, the problems were non stop. Bought movies would cut out, have audio but no video, video but no audio, bad picture reception, you name it. TV shows had the same thing happen to them. Internet would randomly die, kick us off claiming no service even if it said we had full strength, and sometimes it wouldn't even let us connect. And whenever we called to complain they were extremely unhelpful, ALWAYS charged us twice and technicians rarely were able to help us."
"Corey of Manassas, VA","May 22, 2008",0,   Every month my bill has been wrong.  Then my service went down for a long time about a month.  They had credited me.

Then a fourth supervisor tech came out with no luck.  Finally a month and a half later a guy at comcast fixed it on the phone. We called comcast to ask what the bill would be with our credit.They said $87.00 we went in and paid. not to go back to the beginning but they were double billing me and admitted to it in 2007 for internet for 7 months.

"Carrie of Boston, MA","May 9, 2008",0,"We signed up for a basic cable and Internet package when we first moved to East Boston. Because we are in East Boston we HAD NO CHOICE of a provider. Comcast sent us a modem that kept working poorly, shutting off, and disconnecting. I contacted customer service twice about the problem--the first time they told me I had to increase my plan to get a better modem. The second person actually told me that I had a poorly made, out of date modem. My boyfriend took the modem back to a Comcast agent at a location. He said he waited in a long line full of angry customers, most returning faulty modems. The rep was not helpful, and rude in fact. We purchased our own modem, for $80, and not it works fine. Needless to say, our first four months of service was at a cost, for shoddy service. They refused to give us any money back or reduce the bill. I can't wait until we get another provider in the area, or move.$80 for new modem, $12 in fees, and additional wasted time on the telephone (phone bill costs)- 3 hours or so."
"Dan of Cooper City, FL","May 2, 2008",0,"Comcast came to house and switched us over  to their all in one (phone/internet/cable) package. This complaint is about the internet. Since their install, our virus protection and other programs cannot go online for updates. Calls to their tech support result in either being put on hold and then the call dropped (3X), or not understanding the problem at all. Finally a tech stayed with the call and after wasting 15 minutes, said he would write up a ticket for a tech to handle it, which would take up to 72 BUSINESS hours (today is Friday.). I thought I was ALREADY talking to a tech, but evidently the people they use on the first line of customer service (if you can call it that) really are not equipped to do much. One can sense this by their general cluelessness and frequent inability to retain a phone call. If this is any indication, COMCAST hi speed internet maintains one of the worst tech support centers I have encountered anywhere. The bottom line is that their installation screwed up our computer and they dont seem in any rush whatsoever to make it right... they have their upfront installation fee and the customer be damned. Consumers BEWARE!Without virus protection or online backup until this is resolved, and judging from their support I doubt they will resolve it anytime soon."

"Caroline of Plantation, FL","March 12, 2008",0,"There is simply not enough time and space to explain the difficulties we have had with Comcast's cable television service.  At times, the screen and various channels are blacked out, with a nice little message stating your channel will be available shortly.  Apparently the space time continuum is off in their neighborhood, as the channels often take days to come back on.  When the channels do work, they are pixilated, and the sound is often out of sync with the pictures. I am down to about 5 usable channels that I do not truly care to watch.  Does Fox own Comcast, because Fox news apparently never has any problems!

How can someone pay their bill on time when they don't receive it until the day before it's due. By the way, we pay in ADVANCE. Not for service used. Service that will be used! I think that Comcast sends these bills out late so you will make a late payment. There is no postmark on the bill either. They know there are not a lot of options for cable TV and they have got you. I always pay my bills on time and I have excellent credit. Why do people have to put up with this? They say they cannot email you a bill or remind you ahead.

The first person I called to see why I had voice mail and ask them how to get the flashing light to go off, said it would take 72 hours before they could take it off. Why is the world so rude and complicated? I pay around $200 per MONTH to cable - enough for a new car payment - and the service is terrible.

"Linda of Skokie, IL","Jan. 6, 2008",0,"I believe Comcast has been overcharging their customers with prorating and billing errors. I had cable with Comcast and internet thru Earthlink and the phone with AT& T. After many telemarketing calls from Comcast about the Triple play, I made the switch to go with their Triple play for $99.00 for twelve months which includes digital voice, cable and internet.  Since then my bills have not been correct. I have received bills for Nov. 07 ($286.00) and Dec. 07 ($213.13). The customer service rep told me to just pay what's on my bill, and it will be adjusted next month. I told her I can't afford to pay this bill with errors now, just tell me what I need to pay.  She told me to deduct the adjustments from total but not to be surprised if it shows up as an unpaid balance in my next bill. She said the problem was a glitch in the billing software. There are so many erroneous fees such as intralata $8.77, PCM $5.00, interlata $7.96 and feature pack $15.00--on the digital voice package that came with bundle in Aug. 07, that put my bill higher. When I questioned them in Oct. 07 the customer service rep said, ""Oh, they have been overcharging you; we will credit you for that.""I have been paying my bills in hopes it will get corrected; but the next month comes, and it's even higher. I am sick of calling trying to correct. I have wasted many frustrating hours and anguish over my Comcast bill, and I have overpaid but can't get them to correct the bill for that month. They told me they do not send corrected bills-- just pay the amount on the bill and we will credit you next month."

So far everytime I changed the services with them they have screwed it up. they bill it totlly incorrect, and when you call back they have no clue who did what. the relationship between the field technicians and CSA's is non existant, and even from the technician's say its horrible.   as a comcast customer, having cable tv and cable internet... you are actually treated like two different customers. Cable internet techs have no training on cable tv, and vise versa. So when you are trying to cooridinate billing, you have to switch back and forth between these departments, who you have to explain you're deal over and over again. i complained about his and they have this wonderful (sarc) Retension department. i believe these are people who have worked both tv and internet and know the packages and prices well, cause obviously no one there has ANY technical knowledge about the service.   my advice is to keep your changes and transactions and SIMPLE as possible."
